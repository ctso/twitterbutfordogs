After Dockerizing a bunch of Rails apps, I wonder what percentage of my life has been spent installing Nokogiri.
@marmaduke All characters would have different powers of analysis or ways to see/predict the future. Also, spiky hair.
Finally listening to the  podcast. Now I really want to see an anime about professional rock-paper-scissors players.
So the characters are different people?...sort of.But this Scotty looks like a younger original Scotty.
Trying to explain to my mom how the timeline works between the original Star Trek and the new movies is futile.
@scoobydoo I think that means you would be good at playing guitar?
@odie the surroundings aka corpses.
I get a lot of enjoyment out of staring and making motor sounds with my voice when a car next to us revs it's engine.
@odie Woaaah, that robot was just trying to do his job. Better outlaw hockey sticks.
Works in my container.
Wearing a new shirt to my tech job today. Hope I fit in.
@scoobydoo I think you meant to say podcast I liked.
Oatmeal really stepped up its game since the last time I had it.
@odie It's all those non-domesticated trains that got loose.
@balto @santoslhalper I buy a lot of car parts. I don't even drive anymore.
@balto @santoslhalper I'm pretty sure that's how birthright works. You have to enforce it or you lose it.
Asked our Amazon Echo to play some music but had connection problems. Now my neighbor's playing what I asked the Echo to play.
@eddie I worked hard on that personalized note. I took a little inspiration from the prompt window though.
Jurassic World was great. Clever twist to splice T-Rex DNA with Jeff Goldblum's.
@clifford you can't just decide that after 40 minutes. that's not even a fourth of the movie!
@eddie When I went to GenCon, there was a big motorcycle meetup. Streets lined with bikers and cosplayers.
Well this isn't creepy at all.
Looks like I'm not having the crab rangoon.
You can't just leave the Josie &amp; the Pussycats soundtrack on my desk and expect me to NOT play it for the rest of the night.
Are you saying 'not a cult' or 'not occult'? ...both?
@dug Ali had issues with hyphenated last name. System generated her username with a hyphen, then said she can't have a hyphen in it. A+.
@scrappydoo Does Dialoguer support creating Dialogue nodes programmatically at run time?
There are 6 Kevins at my client's office now. I'm scared we've reached Maximum Kevin and I'll cease to exist.
@rintintin Ali triple dog dared me, but then took it back when she saw I would actually go ask him. Not a coward, just married.
@rintintin Also, if it isn't Tom Selleck, my world would shatter.
@rintintin I've been trying to sneak a photo ask night but I am ashamed  / a coward.
Just danced next to a guy who looks like Tom Selleck.
There is a guy who looks JUST like Tom Selleck at this wedding.
@rintintin I haven't been able to add a second profile for Ali. Just says Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again. @balto.
@dug First time I've had it happen on Windows 7. I was under the impression that it was a new feature of Windows 8 up until now.
Oh, that's ok, Windows. Go ahead and restart regardless of what I'm doing. I didn't have anything to do today. Whatever you need.
@odie Yes! You guys rock :).
@clifford @odie Loving having list view in folder/all unread! Any chance of getting the source site next to the item titles?
@clifford So close to using Hive as my daily reader. List view in All Unread and at the folder level would make it. So far so good though!
@clifford I've got some friends that want to join me on  My username is bifflechips :).
I guess there's a new pope? Bad day to pick it. News overshadowed by Veronica Mars Kickstarter starting up &amp; Google Reader shutting down.
@toto I own it. Nice day for a walk, too.
Awesome, now Chicago just needs a Skyline Chili.
@snoopy I love messing with the sellers. I always ask what frites are, and after they explain say ...sooo fries then?
Woman in front of me at Starbucks just ordered 10 drinks, each as its own transaction.
I cannot express how much I hate the iTunes application for Windows.
This is reminiscent of the Love Actually gift wrapping scene.
Why is my already boxed Panera sandwich given to me in a large grocery bag?
@scoobydoo Florence from Florence &amp; the Machine was discovered in a bathroom. This guy just needs exposure.
@scoobydoo He's just singing what we're all thinking.
Dude in the public restroom singing Mambo No. 5.
@toto Congrats! Your prize is 94 cents.
@rintintin This particular one we stopped at on the way to Cincinnati ran out.
Arby's ran out of roast beef? Buh?
Buy 1 get 1 free drink at Starbucks? I'll have two Tall Pumpkin Spice Lattes in a Venti cup, please.
@pluto Can you guys offer delivery where CAH isn't on the package? This is the third time I've failed to surprise my wife :(.
The vet just sent me a list of things that are dangerous to my pets, sung to the tune of These are a few of my favorite things.
Saw Skyfall last night, which was pretty cool. All of the high school kids at the Lake were not though.
@lassie I received an invalid key for Battlefield 3 Premium. Support ticket  Could you please issue me a working key?
Testing days right before releases are so boring. I can't even FIX the bugs I find unless it's something breaking. Keep testing. Fix later.
@eddie I think Ursula the Hutt is more likely.
OH: It's work-safe, but the site LOOKS very communist.
In Central Park. Pretty sure I've seen all of it already on SVU.
@scrappydoo Enjoyed your seminar on Designing in Public. Picked up  but haven't gotten to play it yet. Love the look though.
Lunch is just something I do when I need a co-worker for something but they're out for lunch.
@snoopy I'd love to see everyone and meet Soren, but I'm still working out in Itasca. Raincheck, but say hey for me.
@snoopy @hachiko @scoobydoo @dug @rintintin @santoslhalper was just thinking about that, Ali's family was playing Draw Something.
Asked a co-worker which finger he uses to right-click and he flicked me off. Guess it's a touchy subject.
@rintintin Ah, it's been bumped from worldwide for newer news.
@rintintin Dunno what you're talking about. Guild Wars 2 Release Date is today's big news.
Giving labels proper names in a huge report, and I get to the Recall column in the Totals row.
This weekend I realized that movies never have very many sex jokes in them until you watch them with your parents.
OH: I have this person I'm supposed to call named Michael Scarn, but the phone number looks weird. It looks like a bogus one.
@rintintin You say that about everything.
@rintintin That's cool. My suggestion was based on my first initials being KC. Some people would call me Casey when I was younger.
@rintintin Sadness. Are you guys not saying what it is for now? What about first letter? Might impact middle name choice.
@rintintin Did you guys pick a first name?
@rintintin Suggest names like Taco Bell and Doritos, then names like Mal will seem awesome in comparison.
@lassie Yeah! That's the guy I saw!
Saw my first shooting star and a wild turkey this weekend.
Just saw a bald eagle outside of a zoo for the first time in my life.
Driving to MI. Left lane closed in 2 miles and everyone is getting into the right lane now. Has to have some kind of scientific explanation.
@clifford I could outrun a centaur! Love your game, ArenaNet :).
@scoobydoo I'll be sure to tell past me tomorrow so that he knows that I know that it is the life.
@scoobydoo Are you me from my future of exactly one day?
@scoobydoo That would be awesome. Let's make it happen.
@scoobydoo Jealous. It's beta weekend for Guild Wars 2 and I'm at work. On the other hand, I do get to play some midnight whirlyball.
@toto @rintintin I look forward to the proof of knowing what everyone has ever thought. AMAZE ME, MIKE.
What's the deal with NBC shows and the name Kevin tonight? Must be payback for that George Takei voicemail from Community.
@rintintin Can't. I'm too busy CREATING.
@rintintin @odie OMG! I can't believe that just happened.
@lassie Ah! I was thinking about that show last night, wondering when it was going to start. Thanks :).
Heads up, Avatar: The Legend of Korra starts tomorrow morning. Been a while since I got up for Saturday morning cartoons.
@toto Scumbag Cthulhu. Claims to undo reality. Haunts a single house instead.
@scoobydoo It's cool, just cleansing houses of the animated corpses of previous tenants that are trying to lichify themselves. No biggie.
All of the players managed to survive our Call of Cthulhu game last night, and only two of them went insane. Temporarily.
Ran my first Call of Cthulhu game tonight and none of my players' characters went insane. I probably did it wrong.
@rintintin In response to your 9,000th tweet, I'm sharing this comic with you:.
@lassie Nah, that's not it. Your body is just trying to tell you to preorder Guild Wars 2.
@dug Yes! I refused to finish the single player without 100% readiness. Engineer and Adept are my favorite. Also, Krogan headbutts!
@dug Thank you for an awesome series! Mordin's storyline is my favorite. While I would prefer more closure, I still loved my ending.
@rintintin Thank you for the spoiler warning on today's news post. It is much appreciated.
@odie She's probably just embarrassed.
In all this Mass Effecting, I forgot to eat dinner. Classic me.
Beat Mass Effect 2 for the second time tonight. Maximum Renegade, maximum awesome.
@rintintin Hah. I totally changed your tweet from P'owned to P'zoned with my mind.
Disaster Recovery Plan tested over the weekend. Disaster ensues on Monday. Caused by the Recovery Plan. What.
@hachiko Oh man, Justified is so good. It's only gotten better with each season, too.
@odie @rintintin I know, right?!
@rintintin I think it's clear that you need to make a Pizza Hut Alliance, for trade agreement purposes.
@rintintin Those are safe. That's what you should have ordered in the first place. Now I want a P'zone @odie.
@rintintin Well, you only have so much time. He'll know Operation Poisonzone failed when he doesn't see you in the Obituaries.
@rintintin This was delivery? He knows where you live. You gotta get out of there!
@rintintin This sounds like a Seinfeld episode.
@rintintin I hope this turns into a full scale  Manager starts buying up your favorite restaurants. Hangs NO BENS signs.
@rintintin Maybe you should just learn how to make calzones? I'll bet there's even a way to make them cold.
@rintintin Here's my friend Kevin. He's really funny. Do something funny, Kevin. fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
@rintintin It's too late. The joke's too obvious now :(.
@rintintin I want to make a Muffin/Calzone man joke here, but I don't know if you've seen enough Arrested Development to get it.
@dug working on moving some devblog stuff over, I'll link ya when I can.
@dug Been working on a turn-based tactics game.
I just lost to my own AI. Not sure how I feel right now.
No idea how I missed a new Asteroids Galaxy Tour album. Happy weekend!
@dug I'm pretty sure Leonardo Da Vinci kept all of his crazy LEGO designs in a Moleskine.
@hachiko Pay your Comcast bill?
@rintintin I have watched all of the seasons that are on Netflix. It is excellent.
@rintintin Did not seem true to the series at all.
@rintintin I'm sure Juan hasn't seen it yet, but I'll say I wasn't happy with how it ended either.
@toto @santoslhalper  This is more of a winter solution  I was given the skully for christmas, to fit under my helmet.
At the D&D table: What do you mean I don't know the command word? I brute force it. Aardvark...
@rintintin In short: Google can share information about you with itself. Am I reading this wrong or is that it?
@rintintin Oh man, I love freaking out Tux. Since his hair is longer, it covers up any kind of grip he could get with his paws.
@rintintin Ali's mom bought me the Tooks hat that fits under a helmet for xmas. Works pretty well. Nice find.
@rintintin sounds good to me. I want to take a road trip to Dayton in a few weeks, too. Eh, @toto?
NFL supports SOPA? Finally, a reason I can tell my family why I don't watch football and have them not look at me funny ...maybe.
Someone here just used the word grandpuppy. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
@rintintin Cool, thanks a lot!
@rintintin Thanks. Do you know what sizes your monitors are?
@lassie That sounds like a personal problem.
While testing Android voice apps, asked one What's the traffic like right now? and it showed me a picture of John Wayne.
@odie Hahaha, that's awesome. Sadly, I haven't had time to start book 3 yet.
Oh hey, look. Mass Effect 3 has a Collector's Edi...SOLD.
@odie Get Battlefield 3, duh.
@odie Spoilers: it's awesome.
@scoobydoo Looks like google reader syncing is currently broken because of the update, but hopefully that will get fixed soon.
@scoobydoo haha, I JUST got to that website when I saw your message pop up.
I've about had it with Google Reader. What are other people using as their (non-Apple-only) RSS reader?
@hachiko Relevant: PLEASE make the defibrillator less of a pain to kill with? People won't wait around for me to shock them to death.
@odie @rintintin It's like we're 40-year-olds and Google just shut down Usenet.
@rintintin But I agree, it's dumb if I have to +1 something first before I share it. I share too many dumb things that don't deserve +1.
@rintintin I'm guessing there's a Share with Google Plus! one out or coming soon.
@rintintin I dunno, but all of your followers who also follow me do now (but I doubt they didn't already know that).
@rintintin You have to +1 it, then you can share it on Google Plus. I've got you guys in your own Circle. I don't like it, But it works.
@rintintin They've dubbed that feature  subscription export.
@rintintin I know, and the font got a little bigger (unless I was using an extension for that, which is now broken).
Oh. I get it. This is their way of encouraging me to use Google+.
Google Reader just updated, and now I'm not finding Shared Items anywhere @scoobydoo My shares. You has them. But where are they?
@toto trying to fly a helicopter with mouse and keyboard is horrible.
Operation Battlefield-3-Weekend Status: Success. Secondary Objective: Flight Training. Status: Failure. Joystick inbound.
@hachiko Engineers are hanging out of helicopters repairing them. Impossible to take them down, even if disabled. Please fix this.
@dug oh man, that's tough. I'd probably go with the PS3 version if that's where you can play with people you know. Squad up!
@scoobydoo I'm addicted. It looks amazing on my PC, and I'm a sucker for a strategic squad-based FPS.
Last person just left the office. Be advised, Battlefield 3 weekend has begun.
Sent the bug back telling them it won't be a problem for almost 8000 years. Debated setting the status to On Hold.
Upload breaks when I enter 4/3/17989 for the expiration date [sic]. Does it, QA? DOES IT?!
@lassie I assumed this was the case.
@lassie You've made a huge mistake.
Friday afternoon fire drill. At least it's not raining.
Comcast put me on TriplePlay +$15 to bill. Didn't want Phone -&gt; didn't complete 3rd party agreement -&gt; not getting charged. Bill cut in half.
Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Scones, Pumpkin Pie, Dogfish Head Punkin Ale... I love Fall.
@dug I think Comcast is a stupid company that sucks, but switched from AT&T after I had basically the exact same problem as you.
@dug Was on the phone w/ Comcast all weekend. Somehow out of that they managed to make my bill go up $15. Called too late to fix today.
@toto That's ridiculous, you loved Fuego Loco!
@rintintin This is just about what name both go under, isn't it? Streaming and DVD are still separate plans, if I'm not being dumb.
@rintintin Haha, awesome! You have a gym near you or is this outdoors?
Shamelessly stolen idea from @marmaduke.
@odie I wasn't saying e-ink as opposed to actual books. Nook and Kindle both have a color tablet version now.
@odie Your biggest question is, if you want to get the current generation of either one, is free 3G important to you?
@odie Are you looking at just e-ink?
@rintintin Getting married is so 2-3 weeks ago.
@odie @lassie @rintintin It's dericious. Get some.
@rintintin Then why didn't they pick a better twitter name.
@rintintin @lassie @odie tell me how the Arctic Panzer Wolf is, wherever that stupid bar is.
@rintintin I tried to get some Arctic Panzer Wolf from a place that had it on tap, but they had just run out. Let me know how it is.
California store told me b/c I live in Chicago, It takes 5 days to ship to East Coast. I guess it's East Coast if it doesn't touch Pacific.
@scoobydoo  Does not seem like the time to suggest a twitter account.
@scoobydoo A Wendy's basement? Only reason I can think of for being there is you were all abducted by a crazy manager...
@dug 5 people, but last night 2 of us also hopped in on our Android phones while being logged in on our computers, so 7.
@dug I can't make the hangout, but some friends and I have been using Hangouts to play D&D from 3 different states (usually 5 of us).
@rintintin Oh no! It's not a secret anymore!
Why didn't anyone tell me it was International Talk Like a Pirate Day?!
Received compliments on my shirt leaving O'Hare and SFO. I'm clearly more fashionable than @pluto would ever admit.
hog trough dance? wtf weddings?!
@rintintin I am excited for upcoming hoodie weather.
Under my Jones Soda cap: By next month, your responsibilities will be alleviated.
@rintintin Depends on the tip :P.
@rintintin At some point the cheese level gets pretty ridiculous, but it comes back down. Excited for the new season.
@rintintin Psych also came out before Dexter.
@rintintin Been a while since I saw the 1st season. It's more a procedural show than about Shawn's character development.
@rintintin I'm not sure why 3 is a reason the show isn't awesome. Is it because it's not Dexter?
@rintintin Do they actually believe he's psychic in the first season? I thought the police are just ok with it because he gets results.
@toto Do you have webcams in Texas?
@lassie @rintintin  I hated Monk but I love Psych.
@rintintin That show is awesome. If I were a few years older, it'd be even better because I'd understand more of their weird references.
@eddie That's awesome! I love their books (and Rails!).
@lassie There is, but I didn't have the time to stop over there this morning.
The office coffee tastes a little soapy today. Sadly, this is an improvement.
@toto No, you always expect I'm out to get you guys when I'm DMing.
@toto As the main offender, you would. :P.
@lassie When it's understood between the players and myself as the GM that we're on the same side, we tend to have a lot more fun.
@lassie Remember that you are playing alongside your party, not against them :P.
@lassie If you've got any questions, I would be happy to try to answer them. I can write down tips as they come to mind during games, too.
@odie @lassie I know, right? I showed him how to play over a year ago.
How was work today, sweetie? It was great. I indented 8000 lines of text.
Someone nearby is repeatedly making the same three keystrokes. That same someone needs to learn how to use macros.
@lassie @toto Mmm, Urgot Choffee.
@lassie Tell your dad to quit drinking water and start drinking coffee.
@lassie Lawful Good is best good.
The best time to have an Amazon Prime membership is when your AC breaks. Would you like to spend $4 to have it by tomorrow? Duh.
@lassie did you tell her where she could pick up her Darwin award?
@rintintin were you retweeted on anyone's public timeline?
On the plus side, I think we found our Wedding DJ this weekend.
@toto This has been a problem with the electricity in our apartment since the summer started. I e-mailed the landlord about it.
@toto Leverage isn't on the DVR, so the power went out before last night.
24 hours and a new car later, we're finally home to find our power went out while we were gone. Greeted by a lack of AC and some angry cats.
@toto It's a newer version of @snoopy 's car. Thanks for the recommendation Juan :).
What a day. Looks like we're buying a new car.
Car broke down on the way back to Chicago. Staying in a hotel for tonight. Hopefully we can get it fixed and head home tomorrow.
@toto you finally get a new apartment?
@rintintin Top reason to use Google+: It's not Facebook.
Played the Arkham Horror board game for the first time last night. We did not finish, but we know the rules now. I liked it a lot.
@dug @scoobydoo Finally unlocked Unstoppable Wizard last night.
@odie Ali got so angry at me the other day when I forgot to eat. She's just jelly of my sweet body.
@hachiko @scoobydoo But Chris was on the winning team. Now the text is inconsistent with the result of the game.
@rintintin Needed to populate a relationship table between two tables who's rows were initially all related to each other.
Three and a half years after graduating, I used a cross join for the first time today.
@scoobydoo @dug @hachiko @dug The 2nd is best for me as well. In town for sure that weekend.
@scoobydoo I'm actually in town the next two weekends, so that would work. Been going out of town a lot lately for wedding planning.
@scoobydoo Plays really well. I'm still working out past O'Hare, so I'd only be able to make it in to the city after the workday.
@rintintin so many parts of your world.
Just downloaded  on my new EVO 3D. My first purchase. :) @scoobydoo @santoslhalper.
@toto Sorry, seems like it's more serious than I first thought :( Is it your practice space?
@toto Don't you mean grimy? :P.
@rintintin How I Met Your Mother season finale SO GOOD.
@balto Buying one for a friend, will I get two posters if I have two pre-orders in my cart?
Rarely happens, but I love adding comments after the continue condition for a loop that needs to run exactly 3 times. i &lt;3:.
@lassie @toto That is clearly a hypocritical troll.
@toto But it isn't really instant. If you know what you're searching for, are you not typing fast enough?
@lassie @toto tweeted an explanation, so I wasn't sure.
@toto @lassie And just to be clear, you are aware it was a joke, yeah?
@toto What do you not like about Instant?
@scoobydoo Agreed. Mr. T is from Chicago, after all. And Boeing's in Seattle. Where my location-based searching at, Google??
The Konami Code on google.com gives me Boeing's stock price. Not a very good easter egg, in my opinion.
@eddie Hahaha, sounds like he was trolling all of his followers.
@toto Oh, I'm so sorry. How did those get in there? In this next slide...
Ali told me to quit trolling her whole family. I told her no you. Then I fixed all of their computers.
@odie To find more and better coffee?
@odie @rintintin @lassie  Wow, were you guys up early for the rapture?
@snoopy How do you get newer evidence for bible-based calculations?
It's New Laptop Day, which makes me happy. Unfortunately, it's also Learn New Keyboard Day, which makes me sad.
@rintintin I'm sure they're going to just claim to be bad at math.
@rintintin Are you trying to convince me to go to church? Because it's working.
@rintintin It's just a viral marketing campaign. They found out their JESUS IS REAL. REPENT. billboards/barns weren't very effective.
@toto You had creativity over me at least :P.
@toto @lassie  patented inb4mike.
@lassie That's just flavor germs.
@rintintin Always hold out for Section 9. Right, @lassie ?
@lassie @rintintin The trick is to ask it this way: What, specifically, are we forgetting?
Sad that Pixar went with Cars to do a sequel this year instead of The Incredibles. On the other hand, Bruce Campbell voices a new character.
@odie *shrug* Have to handle it somewhere, and it's programmer's preference.
@odie That's why you have a hidden field with the same name set to False.
@lassie Landscape feels more comfortable, and I make fewer mistakes.
@scrappydoo Can we get a Double Trouble Trundle/Rumble Double Double Bundle?
@odie Did you beat the Elite Four?!
@eddie I don't see a problem with that.
@rintintin That's because it's his dad.
@rintintin you forgot the hashtag.
@santoslhalper Hah, they're alright. I need to get back to that series. I branched into the Cleric Quintet at some point.
@rintintin yeah, it helps me align my chakras.
@rintintin never unprotect your tweets.
Bug: Javascript error for users that have apostrophes in their name. Workaround: Fire all Irish and Elven employees.
@odie @rintintin @lassie I rolled a 4. The Cylons won.
@odie We only had 3 people, and I was Gaius, so as soon as someone became a Cylon in the sleeper phase I knew. Threw him in the brig.
Played the BSG board game for the 1st time tonight. Entire thing came down to one roll on a d8 with a 50% chance of humans or cylons winning.
Alright, Amazon seems to be confused as to what a Dune Buggy is, and what a Go-Kart is. CHALLENGE PREVENTED.
Ali just bet me that I *wouldn't* put a Dune Buggy on our Registry. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
@eddie I'm going to have to write a script that filters that out of her browser until she gets her own 3DS.
@eddie Yeah, if Ali didn't play so much Zelda all the time, I'd feel burned by the Wii. I can at least trade my DSLite for credit to 3DS.
I'm going to play lots of @odie  tonight so Portal 2 releases sooner, and I can stop having to listen to people talk about it sooner.
@eddie They've also got a DSi mode, still in beta I think, but gives supported games more CPU & memory, smoother and better FPS.
@eddie I have no intention of using the 3D. That's probably because of the upscale for the screen res.
@eddie I saw you tried out the 3DS, what did you think? I'm considering picking one up. My DSLite is dying and I want WPA2 compatibility.
@lassie You're right. You'll never get another chance, because you'll never go back to Boston Stoker. Ever. Also, time zones and work.
@eddie Are you referring to the 3DS or that their next-gen console will actually be more powerful than current-gen consoles?
@lassie Quick! Write The cake is a lie over everything.
@lassie @toto Don't you mean *an* irony?
@lassie I hope all of the emails you received were about the bug tracker's mailer being broken. That would be so coincidental.
@toto Trance is the better one in my opinion. House is too noisy, dance is too distracting.
@toto I've started using a last.fm station with keyword dubstep.
@lassie @toto It was a quote from our D&D game tonight.
Worst comes to worst, we become vampires and get sweet powers.
@odie The tweet after that is the one that makes me sad :(.
@rintintin @lassie Tear wraps?
@lassie Because not all apps go free.
@lassie I think most apps are cheaper there everyday than in the android market.
@lassie Ali's cousin was practically laughing when he explained it to me.
@rintintin All are forgiven except loss of interest in Castle.
@rintintin Was hoping there was an episode of Fringe on friday that DVRed. Sadly, there wasn't :(.
@hachiko Hah, thanks for reminding me I need to watch the rest of Party Down :P.
@toto @odie Convincing? Sounds good to me.
@hachiko @scoobydoo @eddie I've only seen the first two episodes of Party Down, so I can't comment on how alike they are.
@scoobydoo It was never a show I thought I would like, but a friend recommended it. Now I wish there was more.
@eddie @scoobydoo Veronica Mars is three seasons and created by the same people who did Party Down. Ali and I liked it a lot.
@rintintin I imagine that would be a bit unwieldy.
@lassie @rintintin I'm surprised @odie hasn't jumped in to say lol DayAir rulez! u noobs! :P.
@rintintin I got an email about mine being compromised too. Have all of your emails been about the same provider?
@odie I knew true happiness last night.
@rintintin ...browser-based Web surfing. o_O.
@lassie Awesome. Weaksauce. C'mon.
@lassie What starter? How many badges? Pokedex count?
@lassie I can understand that. But you don't want to play pokemon? wat?
@lassie I am proud to say that I have never been to New Jersey.
@lassie Worst layover ever?
@eddie I love that website. Ali got this one for me a while back.
Just got back from seeing The Adjustment Bureau with @pluto. Loved it.
@toto Lookin' sick and sexy-fied.
@toto Got that glitter on my eyes.
Kevin, is Pikachu famous? (Ali's younger cousin).
@rintintin Oh wow. I can usually handle half of one before I feel full.
@rintintin Oh man. I can't remember which one's were my favorite, but I think Peanut Butter or Cream Cheese sounds right.
@rintintin Are you saying you've never had Killer Brownies before? :(.
@odie @rintintin Juan knows how to set a scene with hashtags. It's romantic, really.
@rintintin both of those things &gt; poor hash tag use.
@rintintin I fail to see what your last tweet has to do with the hit NBC show Community.
@scrappydoo I can't find the map this forum post refers to, even though I'm an Insider. Would love help finding it!
Fixed our toilet with a keychain ring.
@lassie Agreed! Gouda taim!
@odie When did I say it was bad? Cheesy != Bad.
@rintintin I have. It's alright. It's not quite as cheesy as Chuck. The bad guys haven't been as cool as I had hoped they'd be.
@toto It did shut me down for 1 1/2 days. I sunk to the level of thievery though.
@toto I managed to make it out of my parking spot this morning by stealing the neighbor's shovel & replacing it before they woke up.
@rintintin @toto my office is closed tomorrow, so I have to take the day off. shazbot.
@odie Warwick and feeder?
@eddie I still prefer the first, self-titled album, but Pow Pow is a great track.
@lassie I'd like to know where you got the Nice Tweets shirt!
@rintintin That'd be one awesome goat, though.
@rintintin The drive in wasn't that bad. I have a work meeting after I finish at the client (but it can start w/o me), so no big deal.
@rintintin All the snow is in Chicago. All of it.
@toto Oh man, True Grit was awesome. Enjoy!
Been using jQuery more than .NET on my current project lately. Hooray! Programming is fun again!
@odie You've already played more than twice as many games as I have. I can't keep up!
@scoobydoo A powerful masculine voice whispered sweet updates of my pizza to me while I waited, too.
Good news everyone! The Domino's pizza tracker has added themes! I tracked my pizza using the bollywood theme.
@lassie Agreed. Fix them, @toto.
@toto Were you wearing a brojacket like @odie or a pair of Broakleys(tm)?
@toto @odie agreed. why?
Finally have a comfortable chair at work. Whenever someone leaves at this client, everyone hits his desk like vultures.
Burn Notice season finale was amazing.
Watched all of Toy Story 3 without tearing up. Today I am a man.
@lassie LIKE A BOSS.
@lassie typical wednesday night.
@rintintin blegh, didn't see that you won the kindle. ...what I actually meant was Congratulations, winner!
@rintintin so get a Nook?
@odie Yesss. Good answer. @rintintin.
@odie Why did you wake up at 4AM? You better not have started playing WoW again.
@odie How far did you get in your NaNoWriMo this year?
@odie I like both. We'll have to check the google doc.
@toto @scoobydoo when are we making our dinomite/mart-force/cyberzombie game?
@rintintin So does the Nook. I have the same crappy phone data service that you have, but for free!
@lassie @odie Bought. Will go into pile of things to eventually play once at some point.
@toto Your turn again for the game, you still busy? What do?
@rintintin Just finished it. Awesome episode :).
@hachiko Was it really that bad? I thought it was awesome when he ended his final show by telling people not to be cynical.
@lassie This happened to me too. I'm already looking for a new place to go for lunch today.
Ah! Merged the last 6 months of work back into the main branch in an hour. Amazing. Having trouble deciding if that's a good or bad sign.
@lassie Playing D&D helps me.
@lassie Work's been stressful lately. Need something to keep my mind occupied.
@toto The Kirby Dance always helps.
@odie @lassie @rintintin @toto I'm ready to play Dark Sun to help keep me sane. Get your characters up :P.
Just realized I've been sitting here for two hours with my earbuds in, listening to NOTHING.
@lassie There's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes those are the best names.
@lassie What are you talking about? Jim Thunderbrow is classic.
Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear live stream:.
@snoopy Sounds like fun. Just need to find a time I can make it downtown during the week, or a time in OP.
@pluto I'm not a parent, so I probably just don't understand. She was also taking pictures and sending them to her sister. Normal?
This real friday is much better than yesterday's fake friday.
Anyone who can deliver me George Takei's voicemail message from tonight's Community episode gets my eternal gratitude.
Why are gov't warnings on beer qualified with According to the Surgeon General...? As if someone's going to say Pfft, what does he know?
@rintintin Dual crossbow wielding is gonna be aaaaawesoooome.
Someone is shooting nails into the ceiling directly beneath my desk chair. Least comfortable work day ever.
@toto @odie Denying being a hipster is a clear sign of being a hipster.
@toto @odie So you're saying they WEREN'T hipsters, then?
@toto @odie Why were you across the street?
@toto Why did you buy a didgeridoo?
Finally playing some  tonight. It's been too long.
@rintintin Only cool if you said Return from whence you came as you threw them. Otherwise, you're a littering asshole.
@scoobydoo Time Crisis! That list is almost 50% fighters, though.
@rintintin Are you at a computer science convention in Puerto Rico?
@hachiko Joy Yee's Noodles in Chinatown.
Wow. This is the biggest bowl of Udon I've ever seen.
I was woken up today by a man cutting the street with a massive circular saw.
If you don't want to receive phone calls from us, you must provide us with the home telephone number we should not contact.
Can't believe no one has wished me a happy programmer's day today.
@odie Snow's not as bad. And the voice actor is the same as the main human in GW2!
@odie @rintintin GUIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLDDDDDD WAAAAAAAARRRRRS!
@hachiko @rintintin Any word on when the store will be back up? My bday is soon, I'd rather my family bought from you than through Amazon.
@marmaduke Too late. Twitter's over. You missed it.
Played the drums on my desk for about 5 minutes before I even realized it. Sorry everyone in my cube area.
@rintintin I had one of those. My idea that someone else already thought of  Think Matt was the one that showed me.
@santoslhalper If I were the one creating the stylesheets, I'd understand. It's because I'm using 3rd party stuff that does it that I'm angrified.
You can create up to 31 styleSheet objects with createStyleSheet method. The method then returns an Invalid Argument exception What? WHY.
@toto That is the hobo's version of a slick.
Client is telling me to store a 30 megabyte file in SQL session state, a result of having to click too many times on the page. Kill me.
@scoobydoo I have never gotten mine to work properly, either. No idea why this hasn't been fixed.
@odie @lassie @toto @rintintin (did you take AT, Ben?) and I are offended.
@santoslhalper @scoobydoo I'm with Sarah. Nothing to climb but buildings around here.
Net Neutrality's main opposition is complete ignorance on the subject.
Tea Party came out against Net Neutrality b/c it's more gov't regulation, saying Net Neutrality thwarts free speech rights of ISPs. FFS.
@lassie @rintintin had the CySurg implant cameras in his cat's eyes before he left. Don't go to the bathroom.
@eddie Well, if you're mostly just planning to play at home, FFXIII might be the better choice (and cheaper, apparently).
@eddie that's a good point. think you'll be playing more at home or out and about as well?
@eddie The intro to FFXIII is about half of the game. It's completely linear, but I still enjoyed it (the ~25 hours I played).
@eddie If you have a LOT of time to kill, FFXIII. If you want to jump in, and not have to deal with crappy characters like Hope, DQIX.
@lassie all typical cat behavior, from my experience.
Picked up the 1st volume of Chew before I left San Francisco. Read it all on the flight and loved it. Now I have to order Volume 2.
@rintintin Hah! Boston Stoker was my guess before I checked the picture from the Dayton Airport.
@odie @rintintin @lassie I'm planning on making it out to Dayton Aug. 20-22. Bug Mike enough and he might come, too.
@balto @snoopy @lassie @eddie Noddin' my head like yeaaah. Movin' my hips like yeaaah.
@lassie why are you at a starbucks?
@rintintin Congrats from the west coast! We'll be drinking already, but I'll raise my beer in a silent toast.
Finally found some single color origami sheet packs in Japantown.
@lassie I picked it up when it first dropped, but the drawer interface bothered me. It's much better now. Only complaint is twitpic use.
My safety gets in the way of all of my fun.
Waiting for checked baggage is really cramping my style.
@lassie @rintintin I read everything in my own narcissistic voice.
Loving this Automata storyline. Great job Ben Caldwell @clifford @hachiko @rintintin.
@dug Holy crap, these are the best pens I have ever used in my life  This must be my oddest sincere tweet ever.
People keep joining this conference call every 5 seconds. Performance levels are at an all-time *BEEP-BLOOP*.
I hope this is done before my birthday. I& like to go home by October.
My only knowledge of Mad Men is that one of the guest stars from 30 Rock is in it and.
@snoopy Awesome! I'm excited. I'd like to see some Sam Axe character development.
@scoobydoo @hachiko Personally, I feel it needs more, gruesome deaths. I'll still be picking it up tonight, though.
@scoobydoo Haven't tried that with my 360 yet. Odds are one of us will know what we're doing.
@eddie Ah, well here's my spoiler-free review: Awesome.
@eddie @pluto and I grabbed the last volume and finished it yesterday. What'd you think?
@hachiko @dug @scoobydoo Sounds good to me. Large bet on myself in versus mode.
@lassie Bar graphs kill people.
@lassie What about a bar graph that says Yes 100% to the question Do bar graphs lie?
Would love to get the new Chicane album. Physical CD is sold out on Amazon, and none of the MP3 stores have it.
@eddie What did you think of the person with an iPad?
@rintintin See Pirates of Silicon Valley.
@rintintin You make a better Steve Jobs than Noah Wyle ever did.
@rintintin That was my impression as well, until Gizmodo's quote from Steve Jobs said differently.
If the newest iPhone update fixes the antenna, why the free case?
Congrats to iPhone 4 owners, they just won a free case!
@scoobydoo You are in for a treat.
Apparently my tweet about the blinds in Leverage last night made a blogger for curtains follow me. LOOKING AT YOU @pluto.
Offices in  always have quick-pull style blinds. Guess it's better than actors slowly turning a plastic thing as it squeaks em shut.
My dog's name is going to be Megabyte.
@snoopy Same here. Intentionally avoided the first 90 seconds video that was floating around so it's more exciting tonight.
I need to start storing an inflatable raft in my car, so I can get to the apartment from my parking spot. That or, you know, boots.
How much rain does it take to sink Chicago?
@snoopy I can't deny the cornhole/anus relation. Most people will attribute the game to Cincinnati, and while stupid, use their name.
My mom (a teacher) played World of Warcraft for a class she's taking. Asked her if the class was sponsored by Blizzard. Her reply: What?
@snoopy I guess if you want to call Cincinnati Way down south. I always get funny looks when I ask people what they mean by Bags.
@marmaduke Stella's sister :P.
Completely unrelated: Anyone in the market for a used '95 Chevrolet Beretta? Recently replaced coolant Like New!
@scoobydoo We brought up @dug Saturn SL2. Classy.
Finally, my personal favorite: When I make a slight left turn, the car won't shift into neutral.
When I release the brake & hit the accelerator, the brakes won't stick, causing my car to pounce forward.
I'll be able to relax in air conditioning that works, instead of driving on the highway with the windows down.
I'll be able to see if cars are coming in the driver's side mirror instead of having to jerk my neck to look.
@eddie I'll collaborate (and listen) with @toto.
Once I'm in the car, I won't need to pop the hood to replace the coolant that leaked out during the workday.
When I leave work today, I will be getting into my car from the driver's side door, not the passenger side.
@dug @hachiko of course this is blocked where I work.  :( please record!
@snoopy is it still out in oak park? We had to leave for Cincinnati friday night :(.
I'm finally moving to a new cubicle, away from the people talk about their dogs all day. Productivity just went up a million billion percent.
I wish the person I'm working with was taller. He's never in his cubicle, but I can never tell.
@rintintin I don't think I'd do any of those things on a Saturday and probably not a Sunday (haven't had to go to church in a long time).
@rintintin saw an ad on the El where a fast food place had partnered with Mafia Wars on FB. You get a free mafia thing with your food :(.
@scoobydoo I got it for $10 off, which I would say was definitely worth it. I hate the GTAs but I like RDR. Nothing revolutionary, but fun.
@dug So what's your opinion on the Evo after a day or so?
Successfully herded baby bunny away from traffic, back into the apartment courtyard. Herding cattle in Red Dead Redemption all day paid off.
@rintintin I couldn't stop myself. Intentionally misinterpreting questions is too funny to me. Real answer: *shrug*.
@rintintin I guess so, what's the offensive term you're avoiding?
@dug Now quick, root it and install Froyo so it's even FASTER.
@lassie That means you'll have good luck today!
Horrible traffic driving home. Decided to stop in Elmhurst for BW's & Jamba Juice. Hooray.
@snoopy The comics are good, too! The sixth (and final) one comes out soon.
@rintintin that last crash? Right in front of us. I almost caught a piece of debris.
@rintintin we just sat down. Have you seen @rintintin yet?
@rintintin we're tailgating now, gonna be somewhere near turn 1. I'm told we'll have a good view of the high-probability crash area.
@rintintin I'm going to be there too for some reason.  Where will you be?
@lassie I bet waiting in line at our post office is worse today.
@lassie @rintintin Get back to work.
Cubs players get paid to deal with fans more than they do to play baseball.
Finally found a spot at my desk that gets my phone good enough reception to listen to  all day.
@eddie Someone should tell him his strings are upside down.
In a productive mood today, but I'm stuck watching status bars while setting up an environment for a new work project.
C'mon, Microsoft. You're killing me.
No time for lunch outside to read Scott Pilgrim :( Maybe tomorrow.
@hachiko Hoodie. It's been between 60-80F last few weeks.
@santoslhalper Congratulations on the engagement! Missed this over the weekend.
Nantucket Necatars under the cap: Nantucket is not a part of Kentucky. Now they are just getting lazy.
@rintintin Apparently he's bumping George Lopez to midnight. I would say it's irony, but in this case no one likes the George Lopez show.
@rintintin How can they call it breaking news if Conan already broke the story?
@toto Only an idiot would come back looking like himself. If you met, you'd either go into shock or create a time paradox.
@toto Maybe they were separate copies of you from the future.
@toto I leave a note on my fridge.
@rintintin YouTube needs an Auto DJ.
Free cone day at Ben & Jerry's! (between noon & 8PM).
OH at the office Do you think it's possible for a printer to get bogged down with, like, cookies?
@snoopy come to chicago, bookstores know to stock rpgs here.  yes that's a pokedex next to pathfinder core.
@ all my Emmis friends:  Practice for next season?
@scrappydoo I had that same revelation last year. Isn't it AMAZING?
Big Lebowski Alignment Chart (possibly NSFW).
@scoobydoo from what I've heard, you usually don't see it again after the first rrod.
@scoobydoo I got mine back in 2 weeks. Mine just red-ringed last month.
@rintintin You mean Lexii?
Back from Arizona, and I brought a cold with me :(.
@marmaduke good call, it is :) we have plenty of pictures of us looking silly.
I'm higher up than you are!
We killed the world!
Asia is about to asplode.
There are a lot of rules for Pandemic that follow the form If ______, the game immediately ends in defeat for all players.
@toto The lead falls were so we get used to falling. I don't think I was supposed to get that close to the ground though.
Took my first lead climbing practice fall today, as did @dug. I stopped inches from the ground. Epic.
Cyclist almost hit me & gave me a stare like I was at fault: I was parked getting into my car. You were moving. Handlebars are for steering.
Hate the people at UPS who stand at the counter in front of everyone sitting patiently. Love the UPS workers that ignore them.
@lassie It's just that old.
I must be the only person in this building that drinks Mountain Dew (sometimes). My can has an ad for a movie that came out June 2009.
Someone I don't know from Columbus just butt-dialed me. Hi butt!
@lassie Chicago has a suburb that is bigger than Dayton.
@rintintin I guess they haven't heard of the Pre in Dayton.
Sorry if you received an e-mail from me about Google Buzz. Not sure why it's automatically e-mailing people.
@eddie I have the same problem plus a redringed 360 currently residing at Microsoft. I had my fiance hide Mass Effect 2 in the meantime.
@lassie @rintintin I haven't been craving coffee, either. Although if Boston Stoker ever opens up in Chicago, I'm doomed.
@toto I read the end of the Death Note manga last night. It sucked just a little less than the anime.
@toto pics or bearcat isn't real anymore.
The woman at UPS said they get about 4 or 5 red-ringed 360s to ship to Microsoft for repair EVERY DAY.
@odie I already had Mass Effect 1 for the 360. From what I saw of the PC version, I preferred it on the 360, reverse of Dragon Age.
@toto I am all out of timedogs. TIMETUX NOOOOOO.
Blegh. My 360 finally red-ringed on me today. I ordered Mass Effect 2 two days ago. I hope the box art is good? At least the repair is free.
@rintintin Depends. Is that plate across from you the person you're sharing it with? Then no :P.
I'm not sure why the maintenance crew needs a hammer to paint our apartment hallway.
@eddie I don't get it. It's a big version of an iPod that costs more than my netbook, but is capable of less.
@odie You somehow manage to login and actually do something on the days that the CPU usage peaks.
@toto Usually Sundays. Working on a webapp that has a mixed play-by-post/play-by-chat dynamic for continuous play throughout the week.
@toto I have a feeling Google is less concerned about it than I am.
@toto Google's webmaster tools is telling me to compress the google analytics javascript hosted by google to save 13KB.
@toto Why do some people put way too much lime in Guacamole? Blegh.
Finally started watching Battlestar Galactica this weekend. Can't... stop...
Damn you domino's pizza tracker! A 10 topping limit is too low. It is not for my pizza's own good.
@odie If you can do it on command, you should make Are you having fun yet? the trigger words.
@odie There is always one guy who does it. Anyplace you work, there is always one guy. And it kills me :&lt;.
I'm usually pretty good at finding the silver lining on busy days like today, until I hear my biggest pet peeve Are you having fun yet?
On a business conference call and if you want to call me baby, just go ahead now randomly started playing on the line. Best call ever.
1992: I'm not going to do some little happy hour from Omaha at 12:30 Leno said.
@snoopy Burn Notice is still my favorite show. Cannot wait.
@snoopy Hah! I thought the premiere was alright. Monday's episode was much better.
I waited my entire childhood for Conan to take over the Tonight Show. Don't take it back.
.@lassie Stop messing with episode order in your shows. A dead character was alive in Fringe tonight. Ridiculous.
@lassie I assume you meant tangy zip?
@toto I was back at work :( I'm telling them I'm allergic from now on. Maybe if they think I'll die they might remember.
Jimmy Johns Don't give me mayonnaise when I say no mayonnaise. It defiles your otherwise delicious sandwiches.
@lassie why is my christmas present all over your car windows?
@toto I couldn't stop laughing at it. Reminded me of Boris in Snatch. We ended up using an old blanket to carry it.
@toto Just put a bag over it to catch the needles. Like this?!
@toto NOO! No more focaccia sandwiches and awesome gelato. :(.
@lassie I hate sticker rash.
@lassie Is that your belated Christmas gift to me?
@odie Last time I used it, it jumped from cooking to delivered and we didn't actually have our pizza.
@toto Do you need a picture of Tux for reference?
@toto Pics or didn't happen.
Suffered from Phantom Cat Syndrome the whole time we were at my parents' house.
@toto it's a goddamn epidemic.
@toto I imagine the 2 and the 1 will be offset to the top left of the zeros. What did people do in the 1970's without loops?
@eddie I do the same thing, and I feel like I'm competing against store owners for politeness when I buy things from them.
Our REAL pizza is here. We got 2 free sprites and they made a large instead of a medium, as if they knew this would happen. Apology accepted.
It got here, but it's not our pizza. Didn't notice until delivery guy was gone. Why do you give in to nostalgia, Kevin?
My pizza is on its way. Will let you know of future updates.
I wasn't attentive enough to the pizza tracker to livetweet my pizza status. It's already being boxed.
Watching the status of my pizza on dominos.com. I know it's weird to order domino's in Chicago but I've only had it once since college.
Finally fixed our leaky bathroom sink.
@pluto We are pretty popular twitter personalities.
@rintintin That sounds like this is the perfect game for you:.
@toto Requisition for proper forms to submit request for clemency has been denied.
@toto pics or it didn't happen.
@odie Another friend of mine has actually been using freemind for work for a while and always raved about it.
I swear those lines weren't there this morning!
@odie Agreed, you should pick up DMing again.
@lassie Did you at least wear a condom?
@rintintin I think your syllabus should just say LAMP in landscape.
@rintintin Except for the SQL part.
@rintintin Sounds more like they'd be studying to be a designer than a developer.
Got my first REAL Christmas tree today with @pluto :).
@odie And yet still one day closer to being dead!
@rintintin I didn't know they were leaving/had left. How'd they handle the characters leaving in the plot?
@toto omg that narwhal can talk!
@rintintin Are you saying some new breed of polar bees has taken over the school? You're all doomed! Dooooooooomed!
Just found this, of which I am apparently a source. I'll have to go through my tweets to remember what I contributed :P.
Best part of getting back inside my apartment: pumpkin pie in the fridge.
Got back to Chicago at 12:45AM to find a new door on our apartment. And new locks. And no new key.  @toto & @odie.
@odie Pumpkin pie for breakfast! Woo!
@lassie Christmas or winter? I've had the winter, and it's quite good, like all of Bell's  stuff.
When people accidentally leave out words in emails, it makes them sound like a pirate-There be lots of dessert at the meeting!
@toto @rintintin Was the Behir's Lightning Breath supposed to be included in today's errata? My party is still dazed :P.
It's true. I am a corporate puppet.
Retweet this message to help unlock an exclusive Xbox LIVE item for Final Fantasy XIII.
@lassie Then you are doing it wrong.
@lassie Is it called Left Hand Imperial Stout specifically because it is for drinking with another beer in the right?
@lassie Thanks. I earned that.
@scoobydoo JoP needs more twitter.
@toto Awesome! Glad you like it, too. @pluto was the only other person who I knew had heard it. I think On Directing is my favorite.
My first week as a tech lead is almost up and no one has died yet. Sooo I think it's going pretty well.
Glad I have a new Tegan & Sara album to keep me company while I have to work tonight :/.
@santoslhalper A little out of my price range. How about a javascript map? :P.
@odie Ah, it's been a while since I've seen the original. Was the last one supposed to be a political commentary, too?
@odie Really? Did they let you know that they were lizard people?
@rintintin That is probably because J. J. Abrams wasn't involved.
@rintintin I also don't remember them giving away the aliens were bad in the first episode.
@rintintin You're talking about... Universal health care?! I thought it was pretty bad. Nothing like the old one.
@rintintin Why does Beast look so stupid.
.@clifford No, PC has custom stuff like mouse control, text chat in game, and graphics settings. You're kiddng, right? Ridiculous.
@rintintin That's how Ali and I spent the first 4 hours of ours, only it was the whole apartment.
Tegan, the reason you have toothpaste all over your back is because you wouldn't get out of the sink.
Tegan, the tape Ali put on the couch is to keep you from clawing it to pieces, not for you to lick the tasty tasty glue off of.
Looks like I'm not one of the lucky winners, but they'll summon me later.
Do I have jury duty? *drumroll*...
@lassie I am trying to stop it, that's why I'm debugging it.
@rintintin I'll put it in the thread tomorrow.
@rintintin I'm gonna side with @lassie.
@lassie Honestly not sure if I want to do it or not. I could probably get out of it by telling them how spiteful I am of the court system.
Anxious for 4:30 on Thursday, when I find out if I have Jury Duty.
@lassie @rintintin I did feel like a dork for being at a farmer's market, but there was also some spicy salsa that was awesome.
Picked up a block of spicy firehouse monterey jack cheese at the farmer's market today. I have never been this excited for cheese before.
@toto how long were you able to keep it down?
@balto i'd like a wave invite, if they're not all taken :).
@dug Advance Wars :D Ali's been playing a lot of Professor Layton, too.
@toto sounds like you got on one of the better green-line trains.
@marmaduke haha, thanks :).
We already beat our 21d6 record with 35d6.
Sham, you need to roll 21d6 for damage on this guy.
Thanks for the nice tweets everyone  :).
@scoobydoo @santoslhalper Ali said yes :) we're engaged!
Happiest night of my life last night :).
Blegh, stayed late at work today. Was on time until we made a catastrophically large database change.
@toto That's ok, no one ever trusts the one-armed man. It is always the one-armed man.
@lassie It was a trap!
@lassie I didn't even bother to look in the bag. I didn't want to know.
@dug TIE-DYE IS BACK.
@lassie omg, you has teh virus.
Terrible  experience today. Didn't get to play, didn't get to DM. At least got to create a mini-adventure. Still feels like a waste.
@toto Oh god, just googled the OP Journal.
My credit card broke the Soupbox register. My magnetic strip must have a virus embedded in it.
today. My first 3 rolls today: 1, 20, 20.
@marmaduke If you haven't already setup homebrew on your pre:  :P.
@santoslhalper Ugh, had no idea Imogen Heap was half of Frou Frou. On the plus side, I have 3 new albums to listen to.
@scoobydoo I wanted to yell THIS ISN'T BASKIN ROBBINS at her, but then I realized I'm still a sane person and didn't.
Lady in front of me at starbucks has never been here before, she's asking what flavors they have. If she starts asking for sample spoons...
So tempted right now.
@toto I love this weather. Totally serious.
...and we put up special fences and notices asking people not to commit suicide here. None of it worked.
@toto Haha, I hope it was the same girl from before. How have things been lately?
@lassie what did you switch to?
@lassie @odie using trillian astra here.
These are the most excited goats ever.
Hooray! Eberron Campaign Guide came just in time before the weekend!
Amazing weather right now.
@toto I'll be there, but Ali has to work :(.
@toto Tux still eats hair. Not because he's cleaning himself, and not always his own.
Javascript map editor's finished with bulk editing and all that good stuff. Finishing up moving characters around the map before I do forums.
@toto hahaha. did you tell her to learn2chicago?
@pluto @toto IT'S THE RAPTURE!
@marmaduke Not really, I miss osaka :(  Just been working a lot lately.
@odie You could go home for lunch. Get your book, make sure guild wars is installed and up to date, etc.
@lassie Been using Trillian Astra after I found out Digsby is using my computer to make them money, until I kill 3 hours configing miranda.
@lassie As long as you have. How long I've worked with an offshore team is another story. The time zone difference is killer.
Starting to get sick of getting reports for bugs that need to be fixed BY the end of the day AT the end of the day.
@pluto You have to be very focused to crash cars as well as I do.
sad i'm missing out on  this year.
ugh. forgot to have dinner :(.
@lassie Don't worry about logging in, you let me worry about blank.
@lassie are the forums almost done? there must be hundreds, thousands even, waiting to use the broken link on the site!
@lassie You better be sorry for trying to give me free money.
@lassie It didn't. I don't know you anymore. You embarrassed me in front of my barista. (Thanks for the email full of links though).
Drinking coffee at 2:30 in the afternoon. Still tired from this weekend.
Finished season 3 of Veronica Mars tonight and caught the 12 minutes of the season 4 pilot. Very sad that it's not still on air.
Blegh, got a flat tire coming back to town last night. Good day to work from home while it's getting fixed at least.
@lassie what is the estimated distance traveled of the card?
@lassie oh, THAT swillbucks. dibs. but no, they were out of gazebos.
@lassie I hate swilebucks but have a fascination with dollar-associated cards. What else can you tell me about it?
Dreading driving through lollapalooza traffic to get to ohio.
@lassie omg about time. i have a feeling that you're going to like.
@scoobydoo Finally tried out 1v100 last night. Wasn't bad. Sad I have to miss Gabe & Tycho as the guests next weekend.
@toto hooray loophole! Are you guys at the wall tonight?
@toto yeah, me too, but mostly on my pre since I can't get to the site at work.
@toto mine says I have 30 left, which is mathematically impossible. Maybe mobile listening isn't counted?
@toto where can I see my used hours on pandora? Is it in your iphone app? I wonder if you iphoners are the big users, I can't find mine.
@scoobydoo Awesome. One of these days I'll work up the patience to try putting OS X on mine again.
@scoobydoo Hah, you joined the netbook party? Which one did you go with?
@marmaduke amazon.com is the cheapest place I have seen them.
@marmaduke no, it's not really needed to play, but if you have a class you like, there's usually a book that adds stuff to that class.
@marmaduke Divine Power is one of the newest expansion books for D&D 4e. New stuff for avengers, clerics, paladins, and invokers.
After 2 full days, I finally have a working environment to test this project. I HATE Sharepoint.
omg, Divine Power just came in the mail :D New Avenger build looks pretty sweet.
finally got an invite to google voice!
I haven't tweeted in a while...
I have yet to see egg in any of my previous requests at FlatTop. Wanting to put a bowl up on the counter with only egg sticks.
Working on a javascript tile-based map editor.
@scoobydoo good, haven't managed to get OS X on it, it's nice to have for d&d (pdf book reference), or when I want to surf on the couch.
@pluto Sounds like your camera has its charisma score drained.
note to self: tomorrow's meeting pick a seat that ISN'T between two guys who will be talking to each other the whole time.
@toto Haha, how was it? Edible?
@pluto Slowly. People keep saying Inactivated.
@odie I want the rest of the week off. I'm in all day meetings today and tomorrow.
@odie Oh, and also @dug (Blamestorming. We need to have a blamestorming session).
@odie @pluto I blame @hachiko.
@dug @snoopy are at my previous client now. How awesome was your vacation?
Blocked internet: check. USB cable for unlimited Pre battery: check. System: beat.
totally forgot friday counts as holiday. Hooray surprise day off.
Castle Crashers has the coolest ending to any game ever.
Taking the day off to play Castle Crashers.
@eddie I don't know what either of those things are, but the driver was actually very slow.
Still bright, sunny and hot in oak brook, wish some of the rain downtown would move east for no good reason.
@marmaduke nope, i accidentally tweeted it first, and @snoopy must have refreshed tweetdeck in the 2 seconds before i deleted it.
@odie hah, that was me telling @marmaduke about mike hating 4E before trying it.
After trying throwback Mt Dew (& not really caring for it) & now going back to regular (& not really caring for it) i hate it all over again.
@toto We have a surplus of chopsticks. Like a whole part of the silverware drawer dedicated to them.
I am a client ping pong ball.
1-Route all US office traffic through Dayton office 2-Tell employees to do online in-browser virtual machine training 3-??? 4-Profit?
Dear guy who was pissed at me on highway 90 for some reason and was really good at holding a grudge: I hope you got home and got over it.
Brunch is awesome. I need to start getting up for this.
I tried WoW gamer fuel mt dew.  Still don't feel like playing WoW.
First really hot summer in Chicago, and I'm out of town. (Peace out suckers :P).
Sushi Campaign was an amazing success.
Hooray, external DVD drive finally got delivered. Now I get to install OS X during our road trip this weekend.
@marmaduke haha. with the last day in the loop, this is serious business. srsly.
It is a dark world outside. The day star hides itself well. @snoopy and I are dedicated though. Sushi will be ours.
@dug You should have asked someone on the plane with a  to take that photo. Ya know, so we could see stuff  :P.
@marmaduke ugh, i finish up my current project tomorrow :( we were planning on going to osaka then if you're downtown.
@eddie what was that ringtone site that let you cut up mp3 files into ringtones? i have a phone that doesn't suck now.
It is a lot harder to drink from a motion activated faucet than I ever would have thought.
@odie Awesome. Publicly available character sheet means they probably wouldn't have an issue with me putting it on the sandbox.
@odie Did you get the pdf as well? I'd love to take a look if so. At least at the character sheet.
I'm at speedway, directly across the street from speedway. Why, Ind iana, why?
@odie Adds glasses? I want bdubs :(.
@eddie I haven't used camino, but I think it's just something firefox does.
Dell mini 9 is here! If only I had an external DVD drive... anyone have one that they're willing to let me use at the office tomorrow?
Man, so much came out of the leaked webOS image today. Here's my favorite:.
@scrappydoo How about a webOS feature to automatically turn on wi-fi if you're at a certain GPS location? :).
Trying twitpic again with my fu manchu cat.
pretty sure twitpic hates me.
wow, the  is only a tiny bit bigger than my last phone (original sanyo katana) like || that much.
Just got the OS update, major improvement on touch responsiveness already.
i didn't use any of the directions, but the GPS on sprint navigation worked pretty well on the drive home.
only gripe so far is how synergy pulls all of my contacts (including AIM screen names). can't specify certain ones, it's all or nothing.
Also, news flash guy who tried to cut in front of 20 people: standing by the register doesn't make you next when you have to take a number.
Hello from my new palm.
I have a flyer. I hope it means i get a phone.
There are about ten people behind me now.
Heard in line: If you're in an accident in a bus, you're going to win.
Everyone else in line has a blackberry or an instinct. My phone is almost embarrasing.
At the sprint store, I have friends already!
Holy crap... I'm glad this woman didn't hit the store I'm going to tomorrow.
@eddie designers people at my client say that your personal site should only worry about IE 7+, and tell the rest their browser sucks.
You should probably check out all the witty things I tweeted about yesterday for  and add  to them.
I haven't tweeted yet today, and it's.
Practicing faster dice rolling since 5E went real time.
@eddie no, it's better that way. it might even be a good idea to make it look worse in IE6 :P.
What is the TPK Count box for on the new DM Screen?
Some guy was trimming his fingernails next to me on the train. It was pretty gross.
I'm doing a dev i18n demo tomorrow. I hope no one remembers the demo that was given last year, since it will be the same.
Just had the hottest chicken wrap in my life. Rush hour wrap at The Rail ftw.
Had a migraine. It went away.
@toto It is Friday. I require raw fish.
ordered a dell mini 9 today, can't wait to throw OS X on it.
@rintintin Yes. In one of the old podcasts, someone mentioned how the DM knows they've won when PCs ask to change their alignment :P.
Just heard the White Stripes version of Tegan & Sara's Walking With a Ghost. It sounded a lot like my heart breaking.
@eddie i need to suck it up and find a decent netbook to throw os x on  :P.
@toto link to the windows versions plz.
@toto stop bugging me and read:.
NOT at the Indy 500.
My cats are cleaning themselves. They were dirty. Now they are less dirty and wet.
I liked the intro to the random song that came on my Pandora station. I went to look at who it was. Kelly Clarkson :&lt;.
I wanted to get a steak burrito, but when the lady asked me, I told her chicken. It was good.
Waiting in line at Chipotle.
@scoobydoo I see your keyboard cat and raise you another:.
Was debating whether I should go to starbucks today. I did.
@toto I'm the jerk who fixed a bug with the RTE so people could put MORE image maps into pages. Aren't I awesome?
@snoopy it is krod mandoon trying to be serious.
@rintintin I liked her character, too. What little we saw, at least.
@toto I hear they have salad at salad creations today.
Design stuff didn't turn out bad today. Just need a finished logo and a better color scheme and the site will look pretty good.
Setting myself up for failure by attempting to do some design work.
Finally saw Star Trek. No longer fearful of spoilers.
@scoobydoo Ya, you'll destroy me. It'll be great. I'll play as Dan for comic relief.
Awesome, looks like Castle, Dollhouse, and Better Off Ted all got renewed for second seasons.
@odie I can't wait to be home, and pantsless.
@odie  is a great excuse to be as boring as possible.
@pluto @toto But does it have pasta salad?
@toto Do they have caesar salad?
@toto What do they have there?
@toto What's for lunch today? Our list is bland, and we are uncaring.
@odie what conversation? your group has its own. they are waiting for a response from you.
@odie Yeah. It is apparent that our parties have to be forced to work together, rather than trying to actually make a storyline.
@scoobydoo Picked up street fighter IV last night. It's good, but I am not.
@odie ugh, that sucks. you up for a game of something tonight or are you vanguarding?
Brilliant:  Glad Kanye isn't on Twitter to @ me in all caps.
@santoslhalper Enter Palm Pre Contest.
@snoopy i'm craving it for a day i will actually be at the office, like thursday.
@scoobydoo Hah, The Advantage was the first band that I got into after making a Minibosses Pandora channel.
@scoobydoo Have you heard of The Minibosses? They do a bunch of video game music covers.
@clifford @eddie 's episode will be included, yes?
Support Joss: Save Dollhouse. Fans get their voices heard @balto  Please ReTweet and join the cause.
@santoslhalper Isn't throwback only for a limited time?
@eddie even more obvious when developers make _____ designs  :P.
Once he figures out how to retract them, next step: Embedding them into his fists.
@santoslhalper Here's that D&D webcomic I mentioned  (the server is crazy slow on new comic days).
Awesome.  Found the google code repository for the reCAPTCHA ASP.NET library and added in the lang property. Finished with 1 min to spare.
@santoslhalper I never even thought about that.  Is it one-to-one, or are the subtitles actually somewhat eloquent?
@santoslhalper Has to be Pikey.
Are you kidding me? reCAPTCHA's ASP.NET library doesn't let me access the lang attribute to change the language. WTF reCAPTCHA?!
Wow.  was awesome tonight.  Please don't get canceled!
Sweet, 40% off of one book at Borders for borders rewards members.
Busy morning. Demo went well.  Rewarded with sushi and friends.
@odie don't encourage her  :P.
@toto I can't believe I wasn't invited to the decision-making party.
@toto looks like chris doesn't want to go there. 2 against 1.
One of our cats, Tux, drools if you pet him a lot.
@toto apparently twitter doesn't send your password to you when you sign up. want the one i signed chris up with?  :P.
@snoopy It's about time you saw the light.
@scoobydoo is using his english degree to write programs to do algebraic equations.
Was wearing an old shirt yesterday that was baggier than I remembered, then i remembered that was a style (sort of).
Because half of the things I think of in a day cause me to remember particular penny arcade strips, I'm going to tweet the strip & the cause.
Listening to techno/trance so I don't start singing randomly today.
Sweet, now we can watch the swine flu zombie outbreak LIVE.
@toto Agreed, but @lassie is also already taken, sadly, by a fictional character.
@toto ugh, cspags is already taken.  and they have NEVER updated. this is killing our 'force chris to join twitter' plan.
The chicago fire roll at the sushi house clears my sinuses.
@toto so you convinced chris to join twitter, right?
Pandora has tricked me into starting to sing a song at my cubicle twice today.  Damn you! *shakes fist*.
@scoobydoo You made yourself a liar. AGAIN, you double liar.
The place we went for breakfast had  pancakes! Sadly, I wasn't brave enough to try them.
help fix the internet:.
@dug I can't believe you would drink on a school night.
@scoobydoo omg you tweeted more than once, you liar. hope everything goes alright.
One lane highway construction sucks. Hooray google maps.

We got a roomba today. His name is Broomy.
Blarg, stuck around at the office to fix a bug and now i'm hitting all the traffic on the way home.
The drummer is good, the frontman looks like Austin Powers.
Watching My My My now... Pretty sure this guy's keyboard is on the 'toy piano' setting.
Waiting for people to show up to see the band Arma.
Out of work early on a friday. Woo!
I don't like you, activia yogurt.  Regulating my digestive system should not mean making me not go to the bathroom.
@scoobydoo omg you never tweet anymore.
@odie are you gonna get the cylon detector app for your iPod touch?
@odie i'm twittering just to show tegan off.
I've got most of the stuff for RPGSandbox ready. Still a few things to streamline, but if I don't start testing now, I never will.
Going rock climbing at the gym.
One more thing to make a bit more efficient before I'm ready to start live testing RPGSandbox.
Seeing if my new phone plan has kicked in yet.
@odie I feel obligated to stop following you now  :P.
@odie first or second? and did you not finish them?
@odie you would have to learn ruby (and rails).
@odie do you want me to ship you some? fedex overnight? overhour?
Also loved that Sony's implying that Microsoft is taking away constitutional rights by charging for live.
Who would predict a PS3 without a blu-ray drive? The games are ON BLU-RAY DISCS.
Finally found a small lightbox solution that works for me:.
Close to having a usable version of RPGSandbox, hope to deploy sometime next week.
We already have a solution to this!
So the D&D webapp is coming along.  Having some memory issues with one of the pages, need to reduce the database calls.
I ordered a pocket knife from an online craftsman shop. Now I get e-mails about how I can SAVE BIG! on axes.
c'mon, DHL. bring me my 360!
Writing a D&D webapp. 3.5 first, 4E once I get to play.
Wearing my half-life 2 shirt today, lot of comments on it. Kind of funny that everyone recognizes it so easily now.

@dug I tried to make them stand alone.
@eddie Sure! I'll dig around to see if I can get a discounted copy (usually up to my publisher, not me).
@eddie The book should be all ready to go as is. When the book is finally published, very little of the text will change (if any).

Cannot wait for the next season of @santoslhalper, if it ever happens.

@lassie There's a SQL error on the about-us page, FYI!
@santoslhalper Any chance @hachiko wants to sponsor @hachiko?
@hachiko Would you like me to try to ask &amp;yet or Sencha to sponsor? I might be able to help.
@hachiko I'd imagine it's quite difficult to get devices!
@hachiko I second @scrappydoo—T-shirts! Other than that, maybe credit to Sauce Labs or a similar product. Or Nexus phones/Chromebooks...
The alpha version of my book on Express.js has sold over 250 copies! Scary.
Wearable tech should be more than just for white male nerds.
Just bought something on @santoslhalper. Cool concept; you can get bulk discounts if lots of people buy something.
Cool to see the original Quake open-sourced.

@santoslhalper Let me know what you think of the book!
@pluto Hope it could help!
@odie In short: basically all of the middleware.
Just wrote a little letter to the @scoobydoo about net neutrality; I'd encourage my fellow Americans to do so too.
@lassie @santoslhalper Thanks! Hope it can help.
Just published Helmet v0.3.0, a Node.js security helper. Lots of cleanup and much better docs. Enjoy!

GeoGuessr is my favorite use of the Google Maps API. It drops you at a random street view, you have to guess where.
@toto Drake is an emotion.
This dubstep remix of the Banjo-Kazooie theme is WEAK.
Now that Express doesn't use Connect, does anyone use Connect by itself any more?
@rintintin Does this interest you?
@clifford Getting this (302 redirects) from both Firefox and Chrome….
@marmaduke dog I live here.
@rintintin if there were no hotties would you feel the same.

We call our roads and bridges and water and sewer pipe networks public infrastructure … what about the Internet?
@dug Would love to donate bitcoin to @hachiko. Is such an option available?
*man yells nonsense out his window*Narrator: Don't you wish there were a better way?
@toto It's Ruby-specific but.
@toto I had a nerdgasm when I saw those prosthetics.
@scrappydoo There's a typo on the sign up screen (should be don't). Just FYI!
@odie I agree 100% with your review of my book!
@clifford I see you're (1) into Vim (2) into Angular and Go (3) in Ann Arbor. We should meet up next week.
I just overheard a woman sigh, and after a pause, whisper the World Wide Web.
How Police Spied on a Whole City.
@scoobydoo Sadly, no—I'm still on a student budget. I was just curious if you'd any experience as a bitcoin merchant.
@scoobydoo I saw that you accept bitcoin—what's that been like?
May we all play a little Game Boy today.
Unabashedly blaring music from old Nintendo 64 games.
@clifford these are the twitter equivalent of ancient aztec gold.

Surprised that physicists believe in true randomness.

@lassie I see. I've been looking to play around with a new language and Rust was a candidate.
@lassie Are you a fan of Rust?
@snoopy No problem! Glad it could help.
@hachiko Does Realtime Weekly have an RSS feed?
@marmaduke Isn't that what responsive means?
@balto Whatever, I believe. Not a joke.

@eddie Thanks for the Vim article—really helpful! I'm gonna go change some stuff now….
Why isn't @rintintin called Vim-im.
@odie @clifford Fantastic site! Very well done.
@santoslhalper Thanks! It seems like it's mostly changing your bundled middleware. There are a bunch of guides online I've seen, too.
omg, Node Weekly featured my article. Very cool.
@rintintin Maybe. I don't know that I can call myself a Git expert, though.
There are a million Git for SVN people guides but no SVN for Git people guides.
This looks cool: easily send messages to GitHub users with their public keys.
@scrappydoo I own one.
Delaware's Child Online Protection Act.
@dug Indeed it does.
@dug I'd mostly like to make sure people stay secure. What do you think is the best way to do that?
@marmaduke Just saw your 2FA site. I've made one myself and yours is better than mine; any way we could merge to avoid user confusion?
@toto ah, okay. Let me know if you have more issues!
@toto What's difficult about it? I might be able to help.
@dug How would you improve it? It's long overdue for a visual upgrade.
@pluto I'm getting 404s on every one of your site's pages, FYI.
@santoslhalper I'm just sayin that you don't know.
@santoslhalper WOAH WOAH WOAH. I have two cats and a dog and LET ME TELL YOU that they can all be nice.
@dug Exactly two years ago, you pade a pun: Thank Evan For That. You then said that I'd feel nostalgic. You were right.
@scrappydoo I have one invite left. Send me your email and I'll invite you!
Why I am I the only one who calls the Ruby programming language the ol' rubes.
@dug It seems like Go is mostly used for servers. I'd love to see it take on UIs and embedded stuff, but maybe that's not gonna happen.

@snoopy you have an unfair advantage.
@hachiko No problem! Enjoy.
@clifford Just got my @rintintin and I'm curious about that too.
Wanted: @scoobydoo code completion support in @balto.

@hachiko Thanks for sharing the site! Hope it helps.
@balto Agreed! If you see anything to add, I'd love a contribution.
@lassie Thanks! Glad you liked it.
All this meshnet stuff looks really cool but hard to get into without a friend nearby. I'd love to play around with it.
@snoopy What's your email? (If you don't want to send it on public Twitter, you can DM me).
@snoopy Not sure, but I have 2 invites left if you need one.
@scrappydoo I've got 2 Atom invites…still need one?
Anyone figured out a good way of putting @balto packages into a dotfiles repo? I'd rather not check in the whole package….
@santoslhalper Thanks! Glad you like it.
The @odie looks pretty cool.
Let me teach you how to publish your first package to @snoopy.
@clifford YouTube, but only for awhile. Writely, Siri, and Android also did well in my opinion.
Just signed a petition to support net neutrality.
@marmaduke Your site appears to be down, giving an Error establishing a database connection error.
@snoopy Thanks a ton! I'll take a look at these.
@snoopy Love your JS1k demo. Have you found a tutorial online for raymarching? I'd love to learn it.
@eddie Are you trying to include a custom font? If so, you can just reference the font as long as it's installed on your system.
I love that this is a real Unicode character.
Just published my first @balto package. Ironically, it's VimL syntax highlighting.
@scoobydoo I like that it's customizable and has dotfiles. That's big for me.
@rintintin It looks like it'll be open source after the beta.
@scoobydoo Both look very interesting to me. I'm excited for both.
@pluto Doesn't it slow JavaScript down a lot?
@dug Thanks! I'd love to know your feedback.
@clifford Not a bad comparison.
@dug it's invite-only for now.
I think the @balto is just another example of the JavaScript takeover of Earth.
@balto …can't decide if trolling….
@lassie I'd be careful about disabling CSP—it can make you vulnerable to some kinds of attacks.
@odie  on Freenode is hoppin'.
@rintintin There was some confusion, but maybe it was just my confusion. It'll be open-sourced after beta.
@snoopy It's OSX 10.8+ for now, sadly.
@dug Update: it'll be open-source after beta.
@toto Looks like  will be open-sourced after beta.
@rintintin It's unclear whether it's going to be open source at this point.
@toto It's unclear whether @balto will be open source in the future…hoping so.
@pluto CSON is CoffeeScript Object Notation (the CoffeeScript variant of JSON).
@santoslhalper Hit me up with your email and I'll invite you bby.
@toto @santoslhalper Does Mike need an invite?
@toto Still need an Atom invite?
@hachiko  on freenode is hoppin'.
@dug Neovim is the only thing I've seen recently that's close.
@scoobydoo I see what you mean….
@scoobydoo What does the icon look like now?
@dug From hanging out on the IRC, it seems like it's not open during beta but will be OSS later.
@dug That's what I think.  and other things like it (with things like node-webkit) seem like the future.
GitHub's new @balto looks SWEET.
@scrappydoo I'd love to play with it if your invites haven't dried up already!
Finished all of the IT Crowd yesterday. Excellent show (except for the pilot).
Just found out about the view command, which is like opening Vim in read-only mode. Occasionally quite useful!
Bummed that @marmaduke is done with Bowser, their WebRTC-enabled browser for iOS. Hope they'll open-source it.
@eddie haha, thank you!
@hachiko I see. Good plan!
@hachiko For what reason?
This might be the funniest Wikipedia page. Thanks @odie.
@odie You're not the only one! I usually have a client and server folder.
I love JSHint, but sometimes you want to disable it completely for a file. Here's how:.
Excited to see where Neovim goes. It's a modern reboot of Vim.
@santoslhalper I'd love to have Karma in Ann Arbor, MI.
I like the Node nop module—a function that does nothing.
Petition: Don't Sell Out The People Of Oakland To The Department Of Homeland Security.
Just made a Node library for parsing robots.txt files. Take a look at cyborg.txt version 0.1.0!
Time to jailbreak Chrome?
@toto @marmaduke It'd be interesting to see population density superimposed on this.
@eddie Could I get reimbursed for travel from Ann Arbor? I assume not, but I might go if I can.
@balto that's the double-edged sword of Express. Have you tried adding controllers of any sort?
@rintintin (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
Just added a bunch of domain registrars to my two-factor authentication list! Stay safe on them internets.
BREAKING: Facebook Burns Money.
@balto enhance in what way?
I'm taking an exam in a room where we're all seated around one large table. This is weird.
Article about people who opposed the NSA and how they were ignored.
@scrappydoo Thanks for sharing! Keep me updated about your security repo.
@dug What are you trying to do?
@rintintin you haven't asked me for that dolla yet.
Just donated to my two favorite podcasts, @scoobydoo and @snoopy!
These beats are dope.
Very cool XKCD about frequency.
@marmaduke The former, although I always find ternary operators more difficult to read than if statements.
@pluto Node is always touted as more performant than others because it's event-driven. I'd say both are relatively secure.
@pluto I've used both, but Express a bit more.
I'm sure there's a good reason there isn't a nice ISP startup. Is it regulatory? Is the infrastructure too expensive?
Wanted: an ISP that's not terrible.
Just read the words classical inheritance in a non-programming article for the first time.
@pluto Glad you liked it! Hope it helps.
Wow, Gulp is easier than Grunt by a mile.
I've recently been using @hachiko integration in Vim and it has made me MUCH faster with them JavaScripts because I make lots of mistakes.
@balto that's pretty LEET if you ask me.
My @hachiko shirt came! Very cool.
alias very=gitalias wow=‘git status’ $ wow$ such commit$ very push.
Are you tryna tell me that @odie has food trucks.
@eddie I'm thinking about playing around with it. it looks trill.
@eddie was project m hard to install?
@dug Yup! Thanks for hosting my site and for supporting.
@santoslhalper There's a link error in your tweet (lhttp instead of.
Just added Ally Bank to my two-factor authentication list (thanks @marmaduke)! Keep your accounts secure.
Today I learned that there's an obscure chess piece called the Nightrider.
This JSON programming language seems kinda cool.
@scrappydoo I think of it more as Connect for ECMAScript 6, not Express.
@scoobydoo I'd suspect (1) people don't know about it (2) people don't understand why it's important.
@rintintin Thanks for sharing my  list!
@scoobydoo I made a list of sites that support two-factor authentication, which might help your hacked friends!
@lassie I started during the first public beta. I didn't use it as my main browser until they added extensions.
@clifford That's how I feel too.
@clifford Technologically and socially interesting. Not sure it's 100% the future, but a very cool idea.
@clifford A little, yeah.
Just updated HumanizeDuration.js to version 0.6.0 with German support!
@balto what if PoZ did this.
I'll be participating in  in a few days. You should too!
@snoopy Glad you liked it!
@dug I think that can be said about me for all types of reading.
@dug I've only read one comic and it was Scott Pilgrim. I'm not sure if I liked the Scott Pilgrim part or the comic part.
@dug I don't know a thing about Marvel but I've heard about this API.
@balto That's the price you pay for (some) security. But I agree that it's too much—this is why SPDY seems cool.
Inbox zero feels so good.
@toto I'd love to hear about your experience. Express seemed more intuitive to me but Hapi intrigued me.
@toto It's gotta be Melee.
@balto Anything I can do to help with this effort?
@snoopy Thanks for sharing my site! Hope it helped.
@odie Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it helps.
@hachiko I've thought about adding something like that to my 2-factor authentication list. Does that interest you?
@scrappydoo this game tight as heck.
@dug I use IFTTT to funnel many RSS feeds into Pocket.
@scrappydoo Glad you think it's cool cool cool. Hope it helped!
Mmmmm yeah those exactly-140-character tweets mmm.
@marmaduke Thanks, Phil! @scoobydoo, I take some comfort in that banks have an even better security measure in place: the law. But still bad!
What is the worst app.
@santoslhalper Haha, love the picture. Thanks for sharing!
They did it. They made a pot-related cryptocurrency.
I didn't make this but apparently I love anime.
Vim will be my Valentine.
@dug Works again — seems like the moment I decide to tell you, it starts working again! Thanks for the site.
@dug I've been unable to reach microjs dot com for awhile now. Is it broken?
Just updated HumanizeDuration.js with Norwegian language support (with some help)!
@santoslhalper It means more for Node, which will have ECMAScript 6 pretty soon.
Aw, @dug has no plan to support new JavaScript features like yield.
Can't decide if I should feel embarrassed when I log into GameFAQs.
@pluto Thanks! Glad you liked it.
Ann Arbor has gotta stop being so cold.
@rintintin Perhaps the fact that Mongo has more users (and therefore more support + community), but that's all I can think of.
There is a religion about filesharing.
The Grand C++ Error Explosion Competition.
@lassie I wrote a tutorial about  that MIGHT help with some of your confusion….
@pluto same for mine, which is why I quit.
@toto My gut feeling says yes, it's a bad idea but I can't give you a concrete reason why...
This new @odie album is p excellent.
@marmaduke This tutorial might be of some use:.
Just voted in the .GIFYS.
@balto no i dont care idk why.
@balto that was my wifi. No jokes.
@pluto I use @dug.
Brilliant: the South Korean government wants you to be able to delete crapware bundled with your phone.
@clifford Two-factor authentication is on a number of other websites, too.
Best wifi network names.
@rintintin I've thought about reading it. You'd recommend it?
About to see a short @scrappydoo talk! Excited.
This Walgreens is not ashamed of its love for Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
@lassie Hope you liked it!
@scoobydoo Thanks for sharing!
@santoslhalper I think it's DEFINITELY worth it for your email (I can forgot password if I'm in your email), and I use it elsewhere too.
@odie I registered  at.
@rintintin dinner line is endless.
Turning up in the @eddie.
@snoopy When y'all figure out transportation details, could you let me know?
My @rintintin breakfast of champions: popcorn eaten out of a coffee filter.
@pluto where might I find a sleeping area?
Pivot your startup into a criminal organization.
Leaving for @rintintin soon!

@dug Thanks for sharing! I love Majora's Mask.
console.loge: such console. so loge. wow.
Google won't break into your home. You'll invite them in.  via @hachiko.
Chrome 32 just broke my getUserMedia. Happening to anyone else?
@lassie Thanks! Super helpful while it's down.
@scrappydoo This is the 3rd time it's happened in a few months. Annoying stuff.
npm, please, I beg of you.
@scoobydoo Same for me.
@eddie I've been working on a list of sites supporting two-factor auth. They might help in the cold winter!
@snoopy @clifford Alright. Good to know!
@clifford have y'all done NLP stuff with JavaScript? …and have you done it with Korean?
Just completely emptied my @dug reading list. I don't think it's been empty for years.
NSA compared to Stasi. Damn.
@rintintin It's to block the other XSS —.
@odie Express seems quicker to learn but it does much less for you. I think both are good choices, but I'm no expert.
@hachiko I see. It's a price I'm willing to pay, I guess!
@balto Thanks for sharing my list! Hope it helps some people.
@hachiko Why? It's certainly less convenient, but it's a lot safer (I feel).
@santoslhalper Agreed! I've made a list of sites that support two-factor authentication, if it helps!
It's so cold in the D.
@toto Click Clock Wood. No doubt.
@santoslhalper Using a VERY long password makes it nearly impossible to brute-force.
@clifford hmmmm...I'll keep an eye on this.
@rintintin This looks really cool. Is it web-based?
Improving my blog's security on the heels of @snoopy's blog hackery.
@lassie What have you found? I'd love to learn more about those solutions.
@rintintin Mincer is a lot like Sprockets from Rails, but I had more luck with Grunt.
@santoslhalper It's also worth adding two-factor auth to other sites too. I made a little list, if you'd like!
@santoslhalper It'd be tough, I think. It's not the end-all-be-all of security, though.
@hachiko Agreed! I made a little list of sites that support two-factor auth if you'd like.
@toto I made a list of sites with two-factor authentication; perhaps it'll help new year's resolutions!
I just went on Steam and searched video games.
Is there a list of current/upcoming hackathons and programming contests?
I don't use analytics on my website because I block analytics on the web when I can (thanks @dug).
@snoopy Great to see that your app is Express-powered, but you might want to app.disable('x-powered-by') to keep hackers out.
Just played Proteus by @clifford and @marmaduke. A sublime, surreal, and recommendable experience.
@odie I'm a web developer who loves your videos. I'd love to help with SRL if I can! Let me know!
Is there a website that shows bitcoin's legality by country?
@eddie Thanks! I think I'm gonna jump ship with my next laptop.
@eddie Just read your great article about switching away from Mac. Are you happy with the Dell you bought? How's the trackpad?
@scoobydoo I'd love to find a good open-source/not evil alternative….
Does anyone know what the X-iinfo HTTP header is?
@balto I see what MIGHT be a security vulnerability on Cryptsy — can I DM/email the issue to you?
@scrappydoo It's much harder for someone to hack into your account; they'll need your phone's texts to log in. Not immune, but safer.
@toto Unfortunately, it's fairly easy to fake what browser you're on, and very hard to detect this is my phone.
@santoslhalper For how much? I might sell mine.
@lassie Thanks! Hope it helps.
@pluto Can I try it with yours when I get back?
@pluto those tags are incredible. Would they work with my phone?
@balto Talk To Me In Korean is a great site for learning Korean. Maybe worth adding?
@hachiko let me know when your post is up!
@scoobydoo Personally a big fan of Jade.
Cool that @dug's corporate expense account is, itself, a Venmo account.
@rintintin Ah, I agree with that completely!
@rintintin I think it depends on the site, but I generally agree.
@rintintin I think they do!
@snoopy Hope you liked it!
@dug That happened to me yesterday. It was super annoying.
@marmaduke really? That sounds dreadful.
Add this to the list of things to hate about US-based mobile carriers.
Entrepreneurs need to be solving real problems. A great read.
@odie I'm making a list of sites that support  which might help your readers.
@pluto Story of my life ;).
@pluto I'm surprised it's so difficult. Good luck!
@pluto SASS is originally written in Ruby, so I'd imagine its JavaScript port is flaky. Works like a charm in Ruby environments.
@pluto I don't much like Grunt but I use it begrudgingly. I got it working with Jade if you need help.
@scrappydoo No problem! Hope it helps.
@scrappydoo If it helps, I wrote a guide called Understanding Express that might explain some things.
@scrappydoo Agreed  it's a lot more like Ruby's Sinatra.
@marmaduke Good luck on your job interview tomorrow!
@pluto Not sure if this helps, but you can put them in your package.json's scripts.
@clifford Glad you like it! Hope it helps.
I still cannot believe Dogecoin is real and that I have a non-zero amount.
Just mistyped my name as Evan Haha.
@snoopy Stumbled upon a videogame-related API….
@scrappydoo Yup jasmine-node lets one run Jasmine tests from the command line.
@snoopy You might be able to do something that gathers the data as it comes in — the graph gets more interesting as time goes on. Maybe?
@snoopy A few ideas: bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies), tweets-per-minute, GitHub, subreddit data.
@scrappydoo Is QUnit not standalone? I thought it was but I've never used it.
@lassie Thanks a ton! Anything else you'd like me to write about? Mocha, Passport, and WebRTC are on my list….
@dug Thanks for sharing my  site! Hope it helps :).
Only one exam left before the end of my semester!
@scrappydoo Turns out that Jasmine has been number 1 for awhile now (for at least two years)! I was surprised too.
@rintintin damn I still love this logo.
@odie Thanks! Welcome to the list.
Thanks to a lot of help, I've added a ton of new sites to my two-factor authentication list!
@snoopy thanks for sharing! Hope it helps.
@clifford Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it helps.
@scoobydoo Thanks! Let me know if you see any sites I should add.
@scoobydoo Thanks for spreading the word about 2-factor auth. I'm making a list of  services which might help!
@hachiko Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it can help some folks.
@dug I'm working on a list of sites that support two-factor auth, which might be useful. Sorry you got hacked!
@rintintin I've been making a larger list of sites that support two-factor auth. Perhaps you'll find it useful?
@eddie Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps :).
@pluto I'd love to add GoDaddy to my list of sites supporting two-factor authentication.  Any links I can put?
@marmaduke Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps!
@toto MY SECRET LAIR!
@balto Thanks for the mention of my two-factor authentication list on Security Now!
@balto The @odie JavaScript Developer Survey shows that people like @clifford, Mocha, and @toto.
@lassie I wrote a short guide about understanding Express if you'd like help learning it. Hope it helps!
@scoobydoo SuperTest is fantastic. Do you use Mocha with that, or something else?
@santoslhalper This is great!
@lassie It actually worked -false alarm!
Gonna start a delicious website called SnackOverflow.
It's all fun and games until you have to parse XML.
@eddie @snoopy You'd probably ignore things like of and the, and then you could manually exclude things like proper nouns.
@eddie @snoopy What would you want highlighted? What kind of control would you, as a writer, want?
@pluto Doesn't seem like it to me, but it's certainly not as big as vanilla JS.
@snoopy @eddie What do you folks think of the English syntax highlighter?
@marmaduke Hope it helps!
@hachiko Hope my list helps! Thanks for sharing it.
@rintintin Thanks for sharing my two-factor authentication list! Hope it helps :).
@scrappydoo Thanks for sharing my link! Hope it helps.
@dug Thanks for linking to my list in your Lifehacker article!
@santoslhalper That's so cool! Thanks for letting me know.
@dug Any chance Venmo wants to support two-factor authentication for better security?
President Obama calls on every American to learn to code. Woah.
It is time for the world's governments to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance.
GitHub and StackOverflow visualized as cities.
@pluto Let me know! I'd love to use it.
@pluto Is Bounty for Code dead? I like the idea a lot.
Blog post: the Underhanded C Contest.
@hachiko Agreed. I'm building a list of sites that support two-factor authentication – would you like to help?
@hachiko Are any of the places you've used 2-factor auth NOT on this list? I'm trying to build a compendium.
@snoopy You can also enable two-factor authentication in lots of other places, which I'd recommend:.
@lassie Of course! Any help is welcome.
@balto Made a list of sites that support two-factor auth. Any way I could promote it to help others?
@rintintin Thought you might want to add some more sites to @eddie's 2-factor auth articles:.
Want a list of every place that you can enable two-factor authentication?
Just donated to @scoobydoo for.
Bitcoin's biggest weakness, as I see it, is that it's largely being used in speculation and not real transactions. (Altcoins even more so.).
@marmaduke I've less than 1 BTC, but yeah. I also think it's very interesting. Interested to see where it goes.
@marmaduke are you into bitcoin?
@toto Very true. I suppose the word seems in my tweet helps.
It seems that we now know the identity of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
Glad we didn't get embarrassed.
@scrappydoo Does Hola work by using a proxy, or by some other method?
@odie I see. Yeah, I wish there was a way to say this function returns undefined, perhaps with a different -&gt; syntax.
Practicing my Spanish on @clifford's new Android app. Really slick.
Damn I have a lot of unread messages from ladies.
@odie I usually just ignore the return values in CoffeeScript in cases like that -why do you care what it returns?
@odie You might be able to do `el.addEventListener 'click', @scoobydoo.bind(this)`, but that's the best I can think of.
Just donated a little bit of money to npm!
@odie There must be a more elegant way to do that, but I admit I can't think of one.
I like the idea of live coding mentioned in this article.
@rintintin It's settled, then!
Finally started playing with Browserify...it is amazing.
Is there any reason to use Underscore.js instead of Lodash.js?
@dug Bitcoin would be awesome to have on Newegg!
@hachiko I don't know of one. Maybe I should hunt for some NLP libraries.
@hachiko I thought it'd be cool to highlight based on part of speech, but that seems computationally taxing.
@hachiko What are your thoughts on the idea?
@pluto My name is also Evan Hahn and I'm also a developer. Is there a rule that says that we must fight?
@marmaduke Glad you liked it! Hope it helped.
An experiment: syntax highlighting for English. Scroll a bit to see what it looks like. Would love your thoughts.
Vim completely obliterates fiction.
Anyone have an invite to Lobsters?
I do not remember writing this code but I am glad I did.
The second operating system hiding in every mobile phone.

Just used mkfifo. I am a real Linux neckbeard now.
The Battle for Power on the Internet.
Eating Korean barbecue for breakfast.
@santoslhalper Haha, no -this site stole some of MY content and I found some of yours stolen as well. I wanted to let you know!
@eddie Found one of your @eddie articles plagiarized here. Just FYI!
@santoslhalper Recently found some of your content copy-pasted on this site. FYI!
My shuffle needs to STEP UP ITS GAME.
Brosing the wob with Gogle Chrom.
@scrappydoo Found your Understanding MVC And MVP copy-pasted on a sketchy website -just FYI!
To me, the most striking thing about the NSA scandal is how it's changed my behavior online. I double-check my private messages.
@rintintin I think you might like Oh Land.
@snoopy FYI: found one of your Gigaom articles on a site called OwnTutorials, which has 100% stolen content.
What is this hubbub about Java Script running on the Inter Net.
I can eat 100% of any pizza.
@lassie who are you.
What organizations are trying to increase internet access around the globe?
Google Apps drops support for IE9. Brave.
@toto Seems like it -it's been flaky for me today.
@balto Not just you -it's flaky for me too.
I don't know anything about anime, but Youmacon was super cool.
Great answer to what's the hardest bug you've debugged?
The end is nigh.
@clifford I like to think of myself as a hero.
All I want is unlimited pizza.
@rintintin I am NOT your friend.
@balto Glad it could help!
Was surprised to learn that CSS injection is a real problem.
@balto send me screens.
Second day in a row that there's a milk-carrying man on the bus. This is a different guy and has two gallons. Is this a conspiracy.
@clifford It's been sorta put on hold -I've been busy with classes. I want to get back to it when I have more time!
@dug I also love software updates. I updated immediately even though I had things to do.
@dug It doesn't feel like a big upgrade, I'd say.
I want to know the story behind the guy on the bus wearing the suit, holding a giant poster board and a quart of milk.
@snoopy haha, completely misread that. Sorry! It was a smooth upgrade for me, too.
Downloading OS X Mavericks. Finally I shall surf the web on a surf-themed operating system.
@snoopy Do you know what messed it up? I'm downloading it now and don't want that to happen.
Glad @toto told the @scoobydoo crowd that the Bay Area has great burritos.
Excited to see @toto give his talk!
Thank you for Sriracha sauce, Huy Fong Foods.
For those who don't know, this is what computers are like.
@marmaduke Right. I didn't quite agree with the article -I think they missed the point.
@marmaduke I thought it odd to suggest that some women may not even WANT a seat at the table, rather than some PEOPLE may not want one.
@lassie haha, thanks! In what way(s) are we similar?
@marmaduke Would be interested to know your thoughts on this.
@pluto But do people /dislike/ GitHub?
Are there programmers who don't like GitHub?
Happy Ada Lovelace Day!
Pi is a silly constant.
Wow I wish I had more Google+ ads in every part of Google.
@clifford glad it could help! good luck!
My class is being taught by a brony.
@santoslhalper Any reason to use Disconnect Search with DuckDuckGo? Perhaps to hide my searches from an ISP?
Makin' apps and takin' naps.
Just added Korean support to Humanize Duration, my little JavaScript library for turning milliseconds into words.
@marmaduke EJS is probably more accessible to people who already know HTML, but I like Jade.
@marmaduke Really good. Like, really good.
Seeing Radiolab live! Very excited.
@marmaduke I like Jade. Makes for fewer lines of code.
@santoslhalper you disgust me.
Just taking normal screenshots while browsing the web.
@scrappydoo I believe the first version isn't written in CoffeeScript, but each subsequent version can be written in the previous version.
How many people are in space right now, dot com.
I completed You Can't JavaScript Under Pressure in 3 minutes, 16 seconds! Can you code quicker?
Blog post about Origin, my entry to @hachiko:.
Does Lynx support JavaScript.
@hachiko Glad you enjoyed it! Hope it helps.
A look at the complexity of JavaScript web frameworks shows Ember and Angular on top:.
@odie thanks! Glad they could help.
@eddie I left a blue water bottle at the VMWare talk in the Chrysler Building. Any chance you could put it in the lost &amp; found?
I love how they keep saying danger zone in the latest episode of This American Life.
@rintintin Glad you liked it!
@dug You can. It appears in the real browser console, not the Console tab.
Just beat The JavaScript Warrior. A lot of fun!
I Am An Object Of Internet Ridicule, Ask Me Anything by @snoopy.
The Look In Your Eyes EP by @hachiko. TOO FUNKY.
Excited for @rintintin this weekend. I intend to build a robot that destroys all humans.
@marmaduke If you need help understanding Express, I wrote a guide that might help!
@pluto I'm going to sleep but girl I got u.
@clifford I've done a TINY bit. Basically no.
@clifford CoffeeScript and Sugar.js is also that way.
Just updated my Understanding Express.js guide for the latest version of Express. Enjoy!
The new @toto album is EXCELLENT.
Is there a way I can drive a car with hjkl.
@odie I use the latest -1.6.x.
@scoobydoo What bothers you about Jade?
@lassie Thanks! Glad you like it :).
@santoslhalper I get stuck at the loading screen in three different browsers! :(.
@pluto aw girl, thanks for retweeting me.
Play my @pluto submission! It's horrible. You'll love it.
Get a version of the book made out of PURE INFORMATION.
The new @balto album...it's too good.
@clifford Definitely. I might ask for your help with synths; I'm clueless.
@clifford I'm trying to code up a DAW in my spare time and it's both fun and confusing. Would love your feedback sometime.
@clifford Thanks for the follow! Do you do music...stuff?
Shag carpet may have gone out of style, but rubbing your feet on them never will.
illuminati pizza followed you.
Does anyone on Twitter know what websites are.
@eddie Yes to both, I believe.
Every now and again, I have to go into a DOS command prompt, and it is a struggle.
Does CoffeeScript Have a Future?
Got really hype today explaining HTTP.
I have the power to tweet nearly 145 characters.
@odie girl please that's an adjective.
School is a prison — and damaging our kids seems a bit hard to believe in parts,  but a good read.
@marmaduke I like @marmaduke and @scoobydoo and sometimes @rintintin .
@snoopy do you want hella electro funk.
First day of the semester!
Anyone have experience with HTML canvas-based UIs?
@toto I see. I like that there are fewer lines of code and that it makes scoping easier, but I understand not liking CoffeeScript.
@toto Why does this matter to people? I'm genuinely curious; don't think me accusatory.
New Zealand bans software patents.
@lassie @hachiko Absolutely -the setup is trickier, and sometimes not worth it.
@scrappydoo Thanks for your App Settings on Express.js Middleware -super helpful!
@hachiko I prefer it because it enables me to write the same code in less time with fewer bugs. But it's a matter of preference.
@toto my dad does that too.
@rintintin I'd check @odie .
@dug Do what makes you most productive.
Is there a web application security newsletter of some kind?
NSA officers spy on love interests, which they call LOVEINT. I like that name a lot.
Can't believe I saw the Ballmer news on my weird Twitter list.
@balto ECMAScript 6 will hopefully solve this, and I think Browserify is a good solution too. But sometimes you just need to load stuff.
@balto that actually sounds like the worst.
@santoslhalper Noticed a typo in the FAQ: Every segment of a marketplace has it's different factors should be its different factors.
@clifford In response to your comments here:  He wasn't observing Ramadan &amp; had a real ID. He's not to blame.
I'm at a loss for words -@pluto was detained by the TSA for over four hours. Chilling stuff.
@clifford Promises look a bit ugly in CoffeeScript. Setup is much harder (source maps, auto compilation, etc). I think it's worth it.
@dug That's what happens -I'm on a plane and they inject that script at the top of every page, which I'd love to block.
Playing around with mining Feathercoin (a Bitcoin-like currency). It's confusing stuff!
@dug Would love to add this to the list of blockables:.
@clifford There's controversy around the topic, but I love CoffeeScript. Lets me write the same code in less time with fewer bugs.
@pluto I see. Does your current JavaScript solution work?
@pluto Why not just use .extends?
@pluto What are you trying to do? What does the JS look like?
My phone wisely autocorrects Unicode to Unicorn.
Groklaw shuts down because of government spying.
I always love it when people write hyperlink.

Just posted my first Bower package!
Great (and funny) description of how hard it'd be to crack AES-256.
Needless to say, my family could NOT guess my brother's 20 Questions choice of oil derrick.
@marmaduke where are you off to now?
Going through a pretty serious pita chip withdrawal right now.
Just searched burrito on Shutterstock dot com.
@toto I must say that I think ternary operators are harder to read.
@dug I think that's because the ? checks if something is undefined or null, not truthy.
@hachiko I think it depends on whether you're building a large-scale app that'd benefit from type checking.
@scoobydoo Glad you liked it!
Fixing bugs and giving hugs.
@lassie what the hell.
My first Android app.
@santoslhalper GitHub is down, it looks like.
Atwood's Law says that if it can be written in JavaScript, it will be written in JavaScript. It's real.

SwiftKey got me turnt up.
Funniest video in earth history.
@hachiko MM is more artistic, OO is a more accessible game.

Got that surgical precision in Mario Kart.
They did it. They made their website responsive.
@dug DID YOU SEE THAT GUY WHO SUBMITTED THREE LANGUAGES IN ONE FILE.
@pluto CoffeeScript is more mature and aims to improve JavaScript's syntax, where TypeScript adds features for compile-time checking.
@dug Glad you like them!
My life improved after I stopped caring about spaces versus tabs.
@scoobydoo Glad you like it!
@snoopy woah damn your Scales thing is sick.
the new @odie album, which is excellent.
Guys. I'm pretty sure I found the coolest cake ever created.
This is a great talk about becoming a real programmer. (Don't be fooled -it's not about JavaScript.).
All I want is for @toto to release ▲PERFECT STRIDE▲ I have no other desires.
@eddie Looks like you've been hacked.
@rintintin damn how ya doin is dope.
@rintintin what is this mob.
Time to have the perfect evening with Bobby Vinton.

@balto the Burial at Sea looks REAL.
Current status: eating string cheese like it's my job.
Every time zsh corrects a typo, an angel gets its wings.
I wish that you could sync the settings you've set in Chrome extensions.
Bootstrap 3 goes flat, mobile-first, and renames hero-unit to jumbotron, finally.
@dug I'd add some simple CSS to the web app to improve consistency with your mobile apps. One-line change.
Made a little music with Famitracker yesterday. It's confusing (to me) but very fun.
Fergie is real programming music.
Got my Vim lookin fly as hell.
Wow, Opera is just Chromium now.
@lassie How can I help, as a US citizen?
@marmaduke I looked up random facts before writing that; I had no idea either!
@balto I thought it goes afterward in that case. I suppose I'm not sure.
@santoslhalper What else is there?
@rintintin @lassie Welcome to SoundCloud. It's real.
@balto move the comma in (insert Xbox One-80 pun here,).
@rintintin It wasn't much work to make my blog work in IE8, but I use PIE and some polyfills for IE8.
@marmaduke Glad you liked that line. It was probably my favorite to write.
Despicable stuff. US government wants private SSL keys.
Pretty sure I'm never going to meet anyone amped about how great DRM is.
Just called in to.
@odie I'm one of your constituents. Please support the Amash amendment to curtail unconstitutional NSA surveillance.
I think Google's Chromecast is a pretty big deal.
@balto I'm a big fan of BitBucket for private repos. It's like 90% of GitHub but unlimited private stuff.
@balto You just open sourced BuddyMeme and I looked at your commit log and it's horrible.
@pluto maybe that's a sign that you shouldn't get into Bluetooth.
@marmaduke i'm gonna be constantly doing acid until perfect stride comes out.
@dug I just got it on Steam for Mac -hit me up if you wanna play (and if it's even possible).
My jaw drops at this monolithic, 3432-line vimrc that is large enough to destroy Tokyo.
I wonder how many people who said the pen is mightier than the sword were killed with swords.
@dug On what system are you playing Borderlands 2?
@odie I mean…that's a thing that happens. It happens to me all the time.
What if you could see wifi?
@pluto Not a bad idea at all.
I've been playing around with LÖVE, the Lua game engine. It kept me up past my bedtime.

@eddie a weird idea.
2015: every website is made with Bootstrap.
@hachiko I really liked Code School's Objective-C class (free).
@lassie announces integration with fetchmail.
smh if you aren't using Sugar.js.
I really don't like the programming term duck punching.
@balto truer words have never been tweeted.
My Promise, the new Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song!
@santoslhalper How does sleuth.vim adjust your tab settings? Does it look at the file and detect things? Does it go by file extension?
@balto how would you define the word suppy.
@rintintin Thank you for this link and I am now coffing.
@eddie Are you using any Backbone plugins?
@toto What don't you like about it?

I feel like the Vim/Emacs debate has probably claimed lives.
The worst part about Vim is that you can't give it a hug.

@dug DO NOT go on that guy's website. It's straight a virus.
Switched to a new branch 'pingpong_helmet' (thanks @rintintin).
Statistically speaking, is flying the safest method of travel? Better than driving, certainly, but safer than walking? Biking?
Three years later, FaceTime is still a crappy name.
zsh makes me smile.
@clifford And now I feel like an idiot.

Fun fact: if you're employed by the NSA, laws do not apply to you.
@marmaduke I'm no thief, the internet is anarchy.

What are people using dotjs for?
@santoslhalper pretty specific choice of ancient year.

@dug tell me about your experience with it.
@dug What is this Twitter MMO you've been playing.
@pluto Glad you liked it!
@balto for what reason?
@dug I'm glad you liked them.
@rintintin How can I help you with @lassie.
@dug Did you ever have a good android one?
Let's go on a Kanye Quest.
@snoopy Let me know if you love those.
@odie I've really liked Falcon Pro.
@eddie Recently got an HTC One and I love it.

I recently got an Android phone (HTC One). Anyone have any recommendations?
@rintintin good read. Thank you.
@rintintin Even if I'm not tracking sleep?
@rintintin I don't get SleepBot's alarms. Do they always go off?
@marmaduke Would love to hear your impressions.
NSA spying flap extends to contents of U.S. phone calls.
@balto was it a review having played the game?

First tweet from my new phone!
@marmaduke pls don't die.

@snoopy I can help you because I Linux.
@snoopy Why in the world.
@scoobydoo I'm just getting it because I wanted one and because iOS 7 terrifies me. I will take your advice.
@scoobydoo I am getting an HTC One. Have you any recommendations for me as an Android newbie?

@scoobydoo ON MY WAY.
@marmaduke I saw Sedaris read some passages from Let's Explore Diabetes and it was hilarious.

@marmaduke Tell me how it is!
@santoslhalper Glad you liked it! Thanks for sharing.
@clifford Glad that you liked it!
@eddie Glad they could help!
@clifford I don't think it's MUCH better than bash inherently, but the community is much better.
@toto You are a hero. zsh is too legit to quit.
@santoslhalper Thanks for writing about my Express.js tutorial on your blog! Honored that you shared it.
@snoopy Thanks! Glad you liked it.
@toto Honored that you thought it was fantastic!
@clifford Haha, glad you liked the quote. Hope the tutorial was helpful!
@lassie Haha, glad you liked the quote!
@balto Glad you liked it!
@scoobydoo Thanks for the ZSH configuration post -super helpful!
My Express.js tutorial made it into JavaScript Weekly! There must be some mistake.
What can I do to stop this stuff from happening?
@balto 1 GB = 1 MB. they're equivalent.
@clifford That's either ballsy or those are fake passwords.
Alright, zsh. You will be mine.
@toto Are your dotfiles (or your zshrc at least) on the internet?
@toto I'm all about that customization. It's time to zsh.
@toto Tell me everything you know about zsh.
@clifford Tell me about Fish. I'm thinking about ditching Bash for either Fish or zsh.
@marmaduke I suppose. I'm sure they wouldn't mind much.
@eddie @scrappydoo guys what's with all the lasers coming out of your eyes and mouths.
@scrappydoo It's a good thing their music is excellent.
@scrappydoo Same with Dave Brubeck.
@rintintin I liked  Kim Pine.
@scrappydoo So glad it could help! That's why I wrote it :).
@scrappydoo Glad you liked it!
@pluto Glad I could help!
git push origin bazinga.
@dug Ah, okay. I figured it was symlinking and not some special preference.
@dug Tell me more.
Hit terminal velocity on the Heelys.
Guys what if P decided to be equal to NP.
A method of timekeeping on Mars.
@santoslhalper is the LSAT on a Friday or Saturday?
@dug I thank you for improving my morning measurable amounts.
@marmaduke Your logo looks EXACTLY like the Open Source Initiative's. FYI.
@dug I am actually getting nostalgic tingles.
@dug …mother of god.
@dug WHERE? I LOVE Banjo-Kazooie.
Love what @odie is doing.
@dug It's not working for me either...
@toto ignore that last b.
@toto I'll take a look. Sails looks cool too, by the way b.
I just published a long guide about Express, the Node web framework. Enjoy!
@rintintin I'm on hookcity if you wanna join me.
@rintintin I'm writing a programming tutorial and it's FULL of references to anime. fyi.
@rintintin Indeed. I think I'd prefer a few more lines for a bit more readability!
Woah. Sinatra refactored into 6 lines of code.
What app are you using to get the branch names? he asks as he merges the branch named hit_90_on_the_segway.
mySQL, I beg of you, please.
I have three things on my desktop. (1) a folder called anime (2) pizza.gif (3) Evan Hahn learns the COBOL programming language.txt.
Wrath of Khan Academy.
@hachiko that's actually just for show.
@hachiko and my adorable pop-country lifestyle.
@hachiko your hyphens could use some work.
@santoslhalper I'm actually offended.
I'm writing a blog post and my favorite phrase so far is you will see a dark world of HTML crime.
I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag.
East should be the new North, says this article.
I am learning a little bit of Objective-C and I am amazed that anyone can get anything done.
@rintintin I prefer that approach too, but frameworks can let you iterate much more quickly if you're well-versed.
@dug rap game coffeescript.
@rintintin May it happen this summer as well.
@hachiko @balto Now I'm curious.
I am going to listen to this playlist.
I feel good when I see Merge pull request  from EvanHahn/twilight_rugrats_slashfic in the commit history.
My pull request from a branch called pizza_kickflip was not approved.
My Unicode prayers have been answered.
@toto You know it.
Happy that my website looks okay in Lynx.
@odie haha, will do!
@marmaduke I assume I can't use my student micro plan for whatever I want -they have to be school projects, right?
I sincerely hope I can't OD on fruit juice.
Didn't know about ZZ in Vim. A shorter :wq.
@rintintin If you are like me, it will soon consume you.
@balto I agree. I like so close to cool.
@balto I think Microsoft is close. A company of their scale could become cool again in one year.
@balto I think a visionary CEO would do them well.
@balto DAMNIT. I want them to win.
@dug Dat abstraction indeed.
@dug Basically, they compile to CSS to make it nicer. Just like CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript to make it nicer.
@dug As you get more into CSS, start using a preprocessor. SASS and and LESS are popular, though my favorite is Stylus.
@dug My blood is pure JavaScript/CoffeeScript so let me know if you need help.
@dug I don't think you can CoffeeScript without JS knowledge, but CoffeeScript is lovely.
@rintintin will check out.
I just read the word Java and thought of coffee, not the programming language. Is this what being normal is like.
@clifford That was another time.
Sup haters I'm getting cool.
“We already have what practically amounts to a bytecode VM in our browsers”.
@scoobydoo I'll take a look!
@rintintin My logo looks perfect on this nerdy JavaScript website.
Just published my first package to npm! Scary and weird.
@pluto Looks like it's down for some:.
@snoopy Yeah, it looks like it's down at the moment.
@santoslhalper Have you a preference between TypeScript and CoffeeScript?
@rintintin I'm a fan of it. They don't fix JavaScript's syntax like @dug does, but they supplement it with a bunch of nice features.
@marmaduke Yeah. I don't think it's QUITE as good as GitHub, but I have to be looking for the weaknesses to find them.
@marmaduke Yeah. I use them for private repos because you get unlimited, but I think GitHub has the edge.
Bitbucket is slowly catching up with GitHub.
I had a dream where I became a pizza and it was cool.
Evan Hahn versus the snooze button.
@hachiko Here are my minor comments:.
@lassie @hachiko I don't know about that, but I'm happy to take a look.
I don't trust ternary operators. They're shifty.
@dug hit me up if you have questions.
@rintintin Because I don't like the tracking, I use @dug and block all ads pretty much unconditionally.
.@scoobydoo is just so cool.
@dug Small bug (?) report: there are 2 albums called Sam Sparro by an artist of the same name. 1 is just previews, 1 real songs.
Birds aren't descended from dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs. … This is a good world.
@toto I'm tempted to do a series called Evan Hahn Learns Weird Programming Languages. Your thoughts?
@toto I'm tempted to learn it.
This is the weirdest programming language I've ever seen.
@toto love their homophobia.
Concept: making asynchronous JavaScript loading look synchronous.
There are just not enough flashlight apps out there.
@rintintin DAMNIT, I love this logo.
@dug I would love an npm sticker or t-shirt if DevSwag would like to make them!
I just wrote some code that will break in about eight thousand years.
Que Onda Quero Beck.
Every time I use Z, I'm amazed and very happy.
@rintintin I AM SO JEALOUS.
@scrappydoo I love it.
Just made my first commit to some @clifford code!
PHP, please, I beg of you.
Does anyone out there prefer Mercurial to Git these days? Git seems to have one handily.
Don't know why I was so afraid of learning @odie. It's easy and I feel late to the party.
@dug IMO, didn't like it. I heard the second was much better.
If you'd like, use code DRM2013 today for 50% off on my @clifford book!
Just played a few hours of Halo 1 for the PC. Oh, how I missed this game.
My favorite part: here are fish.
And so my summer begins.
@pluto I am honoured to have provided you with your summer's soundtrack.
@balto That'd be sweet!
I was going to write another semester, another dollar, but my tuition is about 40,000 bajillion times that.
There is one swivel chair in this exam room and I am sitting in it. I suspect it will double my grade.
@balto Is there a way to post an RSS feed with a link to 8tracks?
@rintintin peep this beat.
@balto Would love a Noon Pacific RSS feed.
@toto I find that merges are always a pain but the alternative is do all your work on master.
Just passed 1000 points on @scoobydoo. My avatar is now an exquisite monkey.
Feeling kind of somber trying to work hashtag yolo, hashtag swag into my future epitaph.
smh if you're not listening to funk.
@toto Have you any experience with CDNjs?
@lassie Wouldn't call myself smart, but this seems like it'd be slow, especially on mobile connections.
@snoopy Thanks for your HTML select/option list for US states! (This:.
@clifford You could also post some ideas to the Internet Wishlist.
If you love C++, I'd love to hear why.
I'm not a big fan of C++, but C++11 makes things a lot less infuriating.
@rintintin I'm lucky -I'm flying home on Wednesday. I won't rub it in.
@snoopy he also had some issues with his monkey iirc.
@rintintin I want to go to there.
@eddie I know, but I can't believe I'll probably live to see fusion power happen.
FaceTime is a horrible name.
I had no idea we were on the way to fusion power. This is big stuff.
phuby wraps PHP in a loving embrace.
@scoobydoo I figured as much.
1981 $300,0001987 $50,0001990 $10,0001994 $1,0001997 $1002000 $102004….
Just got my first popup in years, from @marmaduke, no less.
@scrappydoo i don't like my stuff anymore i just kick it from my head, you know what i'm sayin, i can do that.
fergalicious no dictionary results.
@odie Voting would be awesome. I'm a coder and I'd love to help for a few hours if I can!
This is what we call bullshit pseudoscience.
This might be the coolest programming news story I have read.
I think the Internet Wishlist (@dug) has untapped potential.
I just had to stop reading Twitter because I was laughing so hard.
I don't know if I could ever fall in love with Objective-C.
Hit me up on the Internet Relay Chat.
Just backed my first @hachiko project!
Just watched Minecraft: The Story of Mojang. Would recommend!
@pluto I'd love an Add to Rdio feature.
@clifford Any plans to add CoffeeScript support?
smh if you don't prefer CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
Just watched my first episode of a Korean drama. I could get into it.
Do yourself a favor and listen to @balto.
@balto I have to use it for work and it's confusing as hell.
Sugar.js is a pleasure to use. Imagine a world where JavaScript had a great standard library.
I'm glad funk is back in the mainstream. Thanks, Daft Punk.
I'm switching operating systems.
My roommate just caught me bobbing my head REAL hard at the Super Nintendo Zelda soundtrack.
@rintintin I was just asking for an Android-using friend of mine.
@rintintin also, listen to the Daft Punk single.
@odie i &lt;3 kreayshawn.
@rintintin What's the sleep app you use?
@odie Gucci Gucci Loui Loui Fendi Fendi Prada.
@eddie How can I get involved and help? Pardon my ignorance.
That guy was probably not wise to be texting on a motorcycle.
Dat Ann Arbor weather today.
@snoopy that's hilarious Hahn.
Quitting Google Reader has actually been great.
Wait...Chat Heads are actually SWEET. I want that API for everything, not just Facebook.
It is time to move on from Backbone.js -I agree. A comparison of front-end JavaScript frameworks.
@rintintin Thank @rintintin for the logo.
@rintintin it's a DELIGHT.
English Teacher Needs Your Help -And Your Blood!
@balto I swear by Tweetbot.
Locked myself out, but I ate some delicious pizza earlier.
@scrappydoo Have you any places in mind?
Just voted for @dug for the best UX in the Webby Awards.
@scoobydoo I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan and I oppose CISPA. FYI.
OH THANKS FOR THE BUS ERROR, C++, YOU'RE JUST A DELIGHT TO PROGRAM IN.
@odie I LOVE CoffeeScript, and I'm not the only one. GitHub and Dropbox are two major companies that use it.
@scrappydoo In CoffeeScript, I think that nomenclature exists to contrast between =&gt; and -&gt;.
@lassie I believe it's considered bad practice to have compiled files under version control.
Am I a man of mystery if I just like mysteries.
@pluto It doesn't? I had luck with it on my Mac.
@clifford Yeah, it's silly. At least there's a plugin for it.
@balto In what way?
@dug Yeah, it's what I use.
@dug Maybe once every two weeks? It just seems like I'm at the mercy of software, which isn't how it should be.
@dug Perhaps I need to learn iOS development to help my 10 gazillion friends.
@dug I archive a lot of stuff, but I'd rather not have to search everywhere to find an old note.
@dug My main problem with iOS text editors is that they don't handle thousands of notes well. Have you any recommendations?
@lassie Y'all should add yourselves to this page.
@eddie Really? I'm intrigued.
Computer program that learns to play classic NES games is the coolest thing I have ever seen.
@santoslhalper so is homophobia.
@eddie Agreed. I wish Daytum were still developed.
@dug Microsoft Office 2003 and N64 games.
@pluto hey can you arrange another playdate for me and Joe.
@clifford Yeah, I can't really complain!
Every time I use Windows 8, I'm amazed at how much I don't understand Windows 8.
Illiterate except for emoji.
Still deciding what to do with my Raspberry Pi.
@clifford Not really. I bought .5 BTC when it was around $75 and sold when it was about $135.
The real question: will Chrome's new Blink engine support &lt;blink&gt;?
Great presentation on CoffeeScript versus TypeScript.
@marmaduke I'll let you know when I get it and then when I love it.
Bitcoin is going down a lot -glad I sold when I did.
@snoopy You should try Minecraft. It's not quite as volatile as bitcoin but is much more fun.
@marmaduke You've convinced me.
@rintintin You might like The Little Book on CoffeeScript.
@marmaduke What environment are you on? I'm looking for a good TypeScript editor.
@hachiko Are you using TypeScript on a non-Windows machine? What development tools do you use?
@rintintin rap game i love my logo.
@scrappydoo Haha, glad you liked it.
@santoslhalper The is it snowing? example on the goodies page doesn't seem to work. FYI.
This is a fantastic idea: They Should Paint The Bay Bridge Gold.
What if I made a text adventure MMO.
People will still say hashtag swag in the year 2522.
Geneva Convention over configuration.
I like how I use a text editor that's older than I am.
@scoobydoo I'll check them out -thank you!
@scoobydoo Anything you'd recommend? Pardon my ignorance.
@balto It'll go down eventually. It's interesting to watch, though.
@balto About $50. I bought 0.5 BTC.
@scoobydoo Do you use any plugins?
I've made $8 by investing in Bitcoin. This is getting interesting.
Sometimes I want to scream I hate C++ but I'm never in a thunderstorm.
Part of me misses when the whole internet looked like this.
@marmaduke I will read every word.
@pluto Hit me up on internet chat and I'll tell you.
@pluto Take my hand, I will show you the way.
Just beat Bioshock Infinite. Spoilers: WHAT.
@pluto next time perhaps.
Wow, PHP is bad.
All magic comes with a price.
My roommate and I are getting good at making bulgogi.
Is it pathetic that I programmed my computer to wish me happy birthday.
I'd rather be in Boston.
Using Windows for the first time in many years. This is uncharted territory.
@dug I tried to make it short -I hope you like it!
You can now buy the digital copy of my book on @clifford! Do you have any idea how horrifying this is?
@eddie Love what you guys are doing -making me proud to be from the Bay Area!
@dug Thanks! It's my first book, so let me know if you have any questions!
@dug Looks like the ebook of my book is out!
I had a dream that I tried to surf around Michigan.
You just received 0.000008 BTC (worth $0 USD) from an external bitcoin account.
@toto For non-rap stuff too?
What's the best lyrics site? I feel like most of them are horrible.
To confuse it's and its is to commit a cruel grammarcrime.
Jason Derulo needs to stop saying Jason Derulo because he is not a Pokémon.
I'm becoming an avid bus surfer.
@lassie I don't like that it does very little. Without extensions, you write a lot of boilerplate code that should be left to a library.
@dug FYI: my Jasmine book is still not released but will be arriving soon!
@pluto I'll race you. I'm still in bed.
@lassie Depends. I don't like Backbone, but I had to use it once. Same with Ember. I like Knockout and Funnyface. Angular seems best.
@lassie I admit I'm not an Angular man, so I can't be too helpful. It's on my to-do list of things to learn, though.
@marmaduke Does this interest you?
@toto I'd pay around a dollar (US) to summarize an article probably once a month.
The @marmaduke status page says everything operating normally, but I can't push/pull over SSH.
@balto Looks like it:.
Good luck getting all systems back online, @marmaduke!
@lassie Because Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework, it's not designed for testing private methods.
@clifford What did you define as git yolo?
@hachiko It looks like they're being DDoS'd:.
@odie Looks like @marmaduke is being DDoSed:.
@snoopy It might have to do with the fact that they're being DDoSed:.
@rintintin Yup. Looks like they're being DDoSed:.
@pluto It looks like @marmaduke is being DDoSed:.
@dug Looks like they're being DDoSed:.
@scoobydoo Their status page says that they're being DDoS'd:.
@toto Looks like they're being DDoSed:.
@pluto Looks like it:.
@balto Do you like Mailbox?
@dug I believe the book isn't released. I'll let you know when it's out. You can read my quick guide for now:.
@snoopy Ember seems HUGE and kind of scary.
This bus driver is making it hard to surf, but I'm still able to type this with two hands while standing. Phew.
My professor kinda just wrote a shell in class. It was much shorter than I thought it'd be.
Blog post: Backbone.js is larger than you think.
The @marmaduke is very impressive.
@santoslhalper i have way too much work to have built this on a whim.
@lassie Could you break this down somehow?
Twitter just told me to reconnect with someone so I unfollowed them.
@clifford LOVE my Dell monitors. Good choice.
@balto How do I find archived lists and tasks?
@dug Tell me everything.
@dug I'm slowly falling in love with Sublime. fyi.
Just spent about 10 seconds mashing Caps Lock repeatedly in an effort to make it function like the Tab key.
Thanks to @rintintin for telling me about Mosh!
Anyone have large-sized pixel art landscape wallpapers? Stuff like this  but a little larger.
If you HAVE to use Backbone.js, Epoxy.js looks like the best library for doing data binding.
Rap game inbox zero.
@rintintin I just wanna tweet a lot so that I can see my logo.
@snoopy @lassie Odd. Perhaps my (already-merged) pull request was in error.
The only thing I remember from my dream last night was that I paid $80 for a normal pizza.
Thanks to @rintintin for my first-ever logo! Look at this thing! It's so sweet!
@lassie ...very. I didn't get those results on OSX chrome.
@lassie Should I submit a pull request?
@lassie Not that big a deal in Firefox, but I'd object to using Boolean because it's a reference type, right?
@snoopy that looks pretty swee.
@rintintin what is the future like.
@lassie Couldn't it also be var isChrome = !!window.chrome;?
For all of my *nix friends: use this. It will change you.
Awesome list of browser-specific hacks.
I'd rather be bus surfing.
I can't quite get the lighting right for this duckface selfie.
@odie not sure what that meant.
@odie no, like you look nothing like her.
My music shuffle is KILLING it rn.
@dug That was the debate I had.
@odie that looks nothing like you.
@dug I can't intuitively imagine vomit exiting the passenger's seat and entering the driver's.
@dug from the passenger's seat to the driver's?
Holy gosh, Vimperator is SWEET.
Spring has graced Ann Arbor today.
@santoslhalper I hate MATLAB.
@eddie That sounds like JavaScript and I'm sorry.
@odie LOVE the design of your site. Would you mind if I stole some of it for mine?
@hachiko Not sure. Gaining popularity (see  Testing and Benchmarking); Node out of the box; bit more difficult.
@clifford @snoopy That's me.
I made yet another JavaScript class library: Classy.
Michigan, I am in you.
Airplane mode = infinite battery life.
I think I might be the 5th-most attractive person on this flight.
Disappointed that my spring break isn't endless.
@snoopy * { box-sizing: border-box; }.
Hint of lime = hint of nasty.
Just opened /etc/services for the first time. There's a LOT of stuff in there!
Anyone who knows the Aloha Editor able to help me?
Props to Zenhabits for having no copyright.
There is so much cool stuff on this planet.
Typing this with two hands while bus surfing!
@santoslhalper Thanks! I might make it a Chrome extension.
I don't mean to brag, but let's just say that I put the E in JavaScript.
Even I can't fully appreciate how much I love KT Tunstall's music.
@rintintin those are SO SICK.
I'm at a review session and the reviewer is using Emacs. I'm tempted to raise my hand and ask why he isn't using Vim.
@santoslhalper Join me in hating it.
@clifford It's a detailed process.
Evan Hahn: certified lover of the plum tea he bought from that cool Korean supermarket.
I know about Weird Twitter, but is there a Weird LinkedIn.
Every terms of service should look like this.
I didn't know that JavaScript used to be called Mocha.
7:15am will be my bedtime tonight.
Evan Hahn: eater of pizza.
@snoopy exactly. I'm in bed for a longass time.
@snoopy Sorry, completely messed that up. Fermata.
A hub made entirely of gits.
@snoopy It's more like my legato.
Because this is a half-semester course, the first exam I'm taking this semester is also a final.
@santoslhalper Weird little bug on the Wikipedia snippet.
Nobody here reads the git logs. So I've started adding things about my coworkers to my commits.
Java is to JavaScript as Car is to Carpet.
I wouldn't say that getting out of bed is my forté.
Well, this is spooky. Welcome to the Malware-Industrial Complex.
OH: No, Java! No!
@hachiko I find indent guides very helpful. I use the Indent Guides plugin for Vim, and it's built into Sublime.
@hachiko I find the JS output very readable. There are ways to debug it directly that I should be doing, but I've never felt the need.
The @marmaduke framework looks sweet.
All I want to do is write CoffeeScript code and ignore my C++ project.
This is how I feel about Java.
Just wrote var instead of far. My transformation into JavaScript Man has begun.
CSS, I beg you, please.
These beats are inhumanely dope.
Ugh, Bungie's new game looks really sweet.
@balto Looks like some stuff on there is outdated -jQuery is one example.
Looks like @scoobydoo is down.
@marmaduke On YouTube, yes.
How can you program if you're blind? I always wondered.
Back To The Ground @scrappydoo.
@snoopy I think it's better now.
@pluto Yeah, it's happening to me and a bunch of other people.
@clifford Seems like not, sadly.
@lassie It's not just you, by the way -Facebook messages are down for lots of people (including me).
@odie Yeah. A quick search on Twitter showed that we're not the only ones with the problem, it seems.
@pluto Yeah -I think it's just Facebook that's weird right now.
@toto Seems like it -the same thing is happening to me.
@clifford I'm having the same problem.
@pluto Facebook Messages aren't working (and they're not just down for me, according to twitter).
@eddie Yeah, mine aren't working either.
@snoopy same thing is happening to me.
@odie Yeah, it's happening to me.
iOS is overwhelmingly blue.
@odie I think you do. I'm not totally sure about the protocol. (Add me, though.).
Facebook inbox slow for anyone else? Messages won't load on my computer or phone.
@balto I am excited.
@balto I'm particularly fond of ALL OF IT.
@snoopy Is Fetchnotes written in CoffeeScript? If so, y'all should add it here:.
@santoslhalper Thanks for translating -do feel better!
@dug Pretty sure I was quoting you.
@santoslhalper I'm learning  -could you translate that last sentence?
mi kama sona toki.
Feature story about invented languages. Among the most interesting things I've read recently.
Happy Chinese New Year!
I took a public-domain image from @pluto and turned it into a wallpaper.
Take me to your dopest beat.
The microwave oven is an incredible invention.
Buckwheat Groats on LOOP.
@hachiko @eddie Ohh, I get it now. And I agree about Prototype. At least they also added more money with the $$ function.
@eddie I know that Resig is the author, but how was query the answer to the clue? Maybe I don't listen to enough Ke$ha.
Can anyone help me with 17 across, 22 across, and 5 down?
@marmaduke Like...I don't think I fully get what I'm supposed to do when I log on.
@balto GET ON MY ARMAGEDTRON LEVELLLL.
@snoopy don't you worry.
@marmaduke Can you teach me how to use Quora properly? It seems cool and I have no idea how to work it.
What's the best way to learn how to get good with shell scripting?
@snoopy Pushed some changes to the js1k repo. If you run flores, you'll see that I want to make some kind of game.
Wow PHP is horrible.
My life became way worse when I realized that every person on earth has ugly knees.
@dug I am not in 281, though.
@scoobydoo @rintintin Maybe -I didn't go to Pennapps.
@dug How should I interact with these fellows?
@dug I feel like I've suddenly been thrown into a beautiful Twitter thread.
@santoslhalper tip: British people call it rocket which is sick.
@dug Sweet -I'll likely use this. I do use Sublime about once a week, so I'll use this.
@dug Teach me. You will not convert me from Vim, but teach me.
PLEASE LET US LEAVE YOUR DUNGEON.
highlights: FrankenFruit, pizza, no sleep.
quick question: what is a computer.
@rintintin Thanks! Glad you liked it.
So tired, but I built this for.
Wow, I'm dizzy tired.
8:08am: bedtime. Waking up in under two hours.
Wake up, we're going to feed you snakes now.
5:57am and I'm off to bed.
@scrappydoo let me know when it's launched!
@odie Thanks for presenting OpenShift!
@scrappydoo lemme know if you build it!
@lassie I don't think I'll be using the Ribbon API at  but I think I'll use it for another project. Thanks!
@toto there's a livestream.
@scrappydoo I'd use it!
@clifford i cannot get enough of that gif.
@rintintin i cannot stop watching it.
EvanHahn: Tip: Sriracha sauce + macaroni and cheese = top-tier food.
@marmaduke You must trust me.
@marmaduke or just use Vim all day every day.
@santoslhalper what's your alt?
Just tried joining the @dug IRC. It is HOPPING in there.
The Road Not Taken is a stupid poem.
@dug Thanks for awesome!
@dug Ah, sorry -it's called Taggify.
@snoopy students can use Virtual Sites to do cross-browser testing.
@dug Is Taggery something that should be blocked?
@balto WAIT, I THOUGHT THAT CAME OUT IN A FEW MONTHS.
All I want in LESS is transparent mixins.
@pluto I got the Ingress invite but it looks like it's Android-only, sadly.
There is a time and place for Comic Sans: after you've died and are doing graphic design in hell.
Lost all faith in my programming professor when he told me that his variables are called x and his code contains things like x.x.good.
@snoopy Yeoman is on my todo list to try. It seems awesome.
I somehow made bulgogi.
@snoopy I use MacPorts but I SHOULD use Homebrew. I will use it on my next Mac.
Why are hyperlinks blue?
Does my university have a Calvinball team.
Last night I had 2 dreams: one of them had Neil deGrasse Tyson sleeping in my mansion and one of them had me and Obama playing paintball.
@marmaduke the best meal I had this week was Panda Express.
Just used @dug's remote control feature for the first time, and it's sweet.
Today, I am determined to understand Kreayshawn.
@balto Does this interest you?
@eddie It seems useful if you control all of your CSS, but I can see it being abused. Not sure it's a problem, of course.
Nervous about the CSS4 parent selector.
Biggest problem in my life right now: I can't get Asciidoc highlighting to work in Vim. (PS I can never complain about anything ever).
@marmaduke and I will help you fix these bugs!
@dug I KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN.
smh if you say smh.
Holy gosh, my first merged pull request in a major open source thing!
@snoopy What's your email? I would like to discuss js1k stuff.
...we've all got the hang of this smartphone thing now. Let us do what we want.
The Words of Martin Luther King.
Trying RubyMine. Will it beat Vim??
@toto GUESS WHO JUST TEXTED ME.
@dug I agree wholeheartedly. What is this, Auschwitz?
@marmaduke Can I come in with a team, though?
@marmaduke Are teams randomly assigned, or can I come in with a team?
@dug I wish I could've gone to that!
@santoslhalper ok. Tell him to buy Borderlands 2 for Xbox.
@santoslhalper you will not be sick for something so legendary. Which game?
@santoslhalper @lassie Feel better, heroes.
@toto @snoopy I doubt I'm getting a call.
The Vim logo on fire.
@dug @toto Not yet.
@santoslhalper I'd love to have Karma in Ann Arbor, MI.
@toto @snoopy I asked the waitress out. Be glad you weren't there.
This game seems like it is not at all copyright infringement.
I want to help out and put content on @hachiko, but I am overwhelmed by the page editor.
The problem with charring meat at hypersonic speeds is...
@pluto Do you know how to open the JavaScript console?
Coding tip: stop writing code and become Jay-Z.
@pluto Message me if you have one I should hear and I'll tell you how to send it to me.
Playing around with @balto.
I should really have been doing work, but I instead tried coding a little drum machine.
Wait a minute. Prototype.js is kind of sweet.
I've made it 20 years without drinking more than a few sips of coffee, and I think it's time to be introduced.
Looks like @marmaduke is down.
@toto I build the things that I can't help but build because I'm so excited about them.
I'm really glad that we don't live on a tiny golden globe.
Ann Arbor Burger Month's first stop. (@ Krazy Jim's Blimpy Burger).
@santoslhalper At least I was quick.
@hachiko Thanks! It took a bit of doing to make work properly.
Just DOMINATED some Halo  Grifball -this excellent performance will propel me into a whirlwind of fame and money.
@pluto I guess that's true. It's harder to surf the southbound bus.
@pluto From where?? I am so confused. It's just like Bursley-Baits when you're going southbound.
@pluto Was it in the morning? Because then it's Danger Zone.
@marmaduke Worth the $60, by your estimation?
Is RubyMine worth it? I'm writing an increasing amount of Rails code.
I'd say there's a 20% chance that any given trending topic will be related to Justin Beiber.
@pluto In which direction did you take it?
Just ordered Borderlands 2 for Xbox. Goodbye, planet.
This was a nice reminder of why I'm at an engineering school.
@toto I should suffix all my tweets with.
I tweet this with two hands while surfing on a bus.
Blog post: Using the web in 2013 means using JavaScript.
@lassie No worries -I thought it was funny. I wish I could selectively enable that feature for some artists, though.
Google seems a lot scarier when you realize how much they know about you.
@dug DAMMIT! I quit wishes.
@pluto it was weird, I got a pony LEG in the mail. it was kind of messed up.
So I went to check my @dug notifications and.
Proud to have just taught someone the abbreviation ilubby.
11:11am Eastern time: I wish for a pony.
@clifford Agreed. It IS useful in some cases though, to improve the user experience. Usually on only one element, like a button.
I had a dream that Zooey Deschanel put me in the friendzone.

@hachiko Not just you. I've no idea.
To Ann Arbor! (@ San Francisco International Airport (SFO) w/ 147 others).
@scrappydoo I'm glad! Thanks for reaching out.
@scrappydoo Good luck! Sorry I can't be of more help -I haven't used Lua in years.
@scrappydoo That one file is the only file in the project. My guess is that this is due to some Windows/Notepad++ wonkiness.
@scrappydoo That seems odd; tonumber expects a string  and converts it to a number. Try changing it to tonumber(xyz, 10).
@scrappydoo What version of Lua are you using, and on what platform? I'm on a Mac and lua -v outputs Lua 5.1.4.
@scrappydoo Just one file -call it whatever you want (tictactoe.lua, for example). Then run it from the command line (lua tictactoe.lua).
@scrappydoo Sure -what's wrong with it?
@santoslhalper personally, it's my favorite book.
I started coding around 11:30pm. Suddenly, it is 2:30am. I have this to show for it (desktop only):.

Blog post: @odie's Privacy 101.
@dug It's a book that my high school English teacher wrote, called After Dakota.
@toto No idea. I've thought about it but I'm not much of a writer.
Until today, I had never stayed up until 5:30am finishing a novel. Thankfully, I was reading a novel, not authoring one.
I feel like Pizza My Heart would actually be an incredibly dangerous operation.

Fiscal cliff: What if we go over the deadline?

@hachiko Happy birthday, D.
Ohhhhhhh, Jaaayyyson Deruuuuloooo Jason Derülo.
If the icon in this screenshot of the new @lassie means that there will be recurring tasks, I will switch.
@pluto 12 is my favorite number you suck.
12 is my favorite number. Happy 12/12/12.
@balto on the subject of what we were talking about: Windows Phone is simply not better enough to make a dent.
CA$HIOUS MONAY FOR PRESIDENT. Beautiful drawing by @rintintin.
If you don't string your string cheese and eat it like a hot dog, I will find you.

@santoslhalper So far, I feel fine. It was pretty good.
I am about to try drinking this fine beverage.

@balto Do you have any good iPhone wallpapers? I'm in the market for a new one.
I'm sitting alone, writing code in my apartment. I said, out loud, Ooh! Computers.
And so J.J. Abrams trolls all nerds.
@balto SO DO I.
What's the best place to get iPhone wallpapers? I use  for desktop, but for phones?

I should come up here more often. @ Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library.

It's settled: we're living in the future. China prepares to grow vegetables on Mars:.
@balto will do. I don't mountain lion because I'm cheap.
Great video of @dug and @santoslhalper having a chat.
Happy couples are my favorite kind of couple, but mixed-race couples are a close second.
@balto my text to speech instructions MIGHT be different on mountain lion.
@lassie It launches fine in airplane mode. Thanks!
@dug App's repeatedly crashing on my iPhone 4 after update. Sometimes it gets past the loading screen &amp; crashes, sometimes not.

Help I have a chinchilla now.
Solve a perennial programming quandary: 'How do I take good data in string form and painlessly turn it into garbage?'.
Version 2.0 of the @dug app is pretty nice so far, but for the truckload of syncing.
Facebook Messenger for Mac would be greatly appreciated. By me.
No one was going to see, so I used tables in my HTML.
@balto I admit that I'm kind of interested in moving around the country for awhile before I settle down somewhere.
@pluto I might be able to -what time on Friday? Pop me a DM.
@pluto Possibly -what day(s)?
Switching to Linux saves Munich over €11 million.
@balto The colors are better and the connection is more reliable (but that was probably just because I had a bad VGA cable).
@clifford I think I'd rather be a porn star than an assassin. Food for...food for thought.
Wow, a DVI cable makes a ton of difference. VGA, begone!

I feel like Ultimate Frisbee should only be for incredibly extreme people and everyone else should get Regular Frisbee.
@snoopy Only flirted. It looks even nicer. This project kinda requires Knockout.
@snoopy I'm so surprised at how little JavaScript I'm writing.
@scrappydoo Oh yeah, ModelBinder is a great plugin. Big fan...except I don't much like Backbone.
@scrappydoo It's MVVM, not MVC. More like XAML; less templating and DOM building.
Finally trying Knockout.js. So far, I like it better than Ember and Backbone.
@dug I think your excitement indicates that you deserve it more than I ever did. I feel like I'm passing an epic torch.
@dug haha, no idea. Briefly, I think.
Sometimes, I can feel the age of my iPhone 4.
@dug I forgive you.
I dreamt that @dug fixed a minor UI annoyance, which was a pretty boring dream, but then I rode a giant bird into the sky so it was cool.

This song starts out sounding like an old video game, then is briefly reggae, then is NASTY dubstep. Queued up as  of the day.
@pluto I wanted it to be enumerable. So, if I'm at beat 5, I can go forward to 6 or back to 4. Harder with date primary keys on hashmaps.
NO WAY. This is too cool.
@pluto I tried sleeping for two 4-hour chunks every day. After three days of it, I couldn't stay awake and slept for 15 hours.
I drink soy milk like it's my job.

Just burned my fingers on a hot cinnamon bun. My revenge was eating the cinnamon bun.

@lassie Good luck, heroes.
I have  queued up for almost a month but I still need more to fuel my addiction.
@snoopy @rintintin fair point.
@rintintin FYI, a LOT of  are going to be by Justice.
Has anyone else used @marmaduke? If so, what are your thoughts?
@rintintin Oh noes. How bad is it out?
Sometimes, my songs come up on  Wow, somebody else likes the same music I do! But then it's just me and I'm forever alone.
@pluto You know it.
@odie In the US, they give it to you when you're done eating.

Sometimes, I forget to use vimdiff and use diff -y instead, and then I feel stupid.
@odie I am anal about little style choices like that.
@odie Then you are wrong.
If you put two spaces after your periods instead of one, I respect you less.
@pluto Yeah. It was horrible.
@pluto I agree. I did a Star Wars marathon once and I physically hurt.
@pluto I feel like I wanna go back and watch those now.

@santoslhalper Absolutely I did! Wish I competed. So excited for Super Mario Maker.
Guys! Warning: Fatso's Last Stand is pretty fucking gross when you are sober.
Uncharted 4 looks like a Fast and Furious movie; really good.
Mario Maker blew my mind. Can't wait to play it.
Guys, Ryu is currently available as DLC for Smash 4. Nintendo is just the best. Sunday Daddy happy. Close down E3. DOOM is for babies.
Guys! Best Wii U Games in no order: Mario3D, Smash4, Bayonetta2, C.Toad, Pikmin3, Splatoon, DKTFreeze, MKart, LegoUndercover, NewMarioWiiU.
@santoslhalper theoretically Splatoon 64 &lt; Splatoon Melee &lt; Splatoon Brawl &lt; Splatoon 4 (the new one). Just like Smash.
Splatoon is v fun. If this was the 4th iteration of Splatoon, it would be the best. Better than Splatoon Melee.
Guys it's confirmed that n64 smash is the worst followed by gamecube smash. Brawl is second best. Smash 4 is the best.
LIVE on  Smash idiots.

@balto Hey Uncle Cory, can the Double Downer be used against a Wild Magic Card? We have been fighting all night. Thanks Unky!
@rintintin @santoslhalper Psst. You should tweet the 6-digit hashtag with the question so RoboTrebek know what you are answering.
@lassie Haha. Ok, I will play around with it this weekend. Thanks for the support!
@lassie I am only allowed to make 15 api requests an hour.  I could make it tweet all the daily answers at once. Would you like that?
@lassie As it is programmed right now, shorter answers are better. Ex: President Lincoln might be incorrect where Lincoln is correct.
@lassie So anyone who answers correctly gets the dollar value associated with the answer. They can also get money taken away.
@santoslhalper Can you see this?
@rintintin Thanks for the can crush beebee! You are the man!!!!
Just to let everybody know, the only reason that I got a twitter account is to follow @rintintin.
