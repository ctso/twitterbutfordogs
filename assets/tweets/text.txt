@toto the surroundings aka corpses.
Related, probably.
I get a lot of enjoyment out of staring and making motor sounds with my voice when a car next to us revs it's engine.
@hachiko Woaaah, that robot was just trying to do his job. Better outlaw hockey sticks.
Works in my container.
Wearing a new shirt to my tech job today. Hope I fit in.
@santoslhalper I think you meant to say podcast I liked.
Oatmeal really stepped up its game since the last time I had it.
@lassie It's all those non-domesticated trains that got loose.
üç°.
@lassie @lassie I buy a lot of car parts. I don't even drive anymore.
@marmaduke @marmaduke I'm pretty sure that's how birthright works. You have to enforce it or you lose it.
Asked our Amazon Echo to play some music but had connection problems. Now my neighbor's playing what I asked the Echo to play.
@lassie I worked hard on that personalized note. I took a little inspiration from the prompt window though.
Jurassic World was great. Clever twist to splice T-Rex DNA with Jeff Goldblum's.
@scoobydoo you can't just decide that after 40 minutes. that's not even a fourth of the movie!
@pluto When I went to GenCon, there was a big motorcycle meetup. Streets lined with bikers and cosplayers.
Well this isn't creepy at all.
Looks like I'm not having the crab rangoon.
You can't just leave the Josie &amp; the Pussycats soundtrack on my desk and expect me to NOT play it for the rest of the night.
@snoopy.
Are you saying 'not a cult' or 'not occult'? ...both?
@scoobydoo Ali had issues with hyphenated last name. System generated her username with a hyphen, then said she can't have a hyphen in it. A+.
@balto Does Dialoguer support creating Dialogue nodes programmatically at run time?
There are 6 Kevins at my client's office now. I'm scared we've reached Maximum Kevin and I'll cease to exist.
Yesss.
@santoslhalper Ali triple dog dared me, but then took it back when she saw I would actually go ask him. Not a coward, just married.
@snoopy Also, if it isn't Tom Selleck, my world would shatter.
@scrappydoo I've been trying to sneak a photo ask night but I am ashamed  / a coward.
Respect the mustache.
Just danced next to a guy who looks like Tom Selleck.
There is a guy who looks JUST like Tom Selleck at this wedding.
@scrappydoo I haven't been able to add a second profile for Ali. Just says Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again. @scrappydoo.
@scoobydoo First time I've had it happen on Windows 7. I was under the impression that it was a new feature of Windows 8 up until now.
Oh, that's ok, Windows. Go ahead and restart regardless of what I'm doing. I didn't have anything to do today. Whatever you need.
@rintintin Yes! You guys rock :).
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo Loving having list view in folder/all unread! Any chance of getting the source site next to the item titles?
@marmaduke So close to using Hive as my daily reader. List view in All Unread and at the folder level would make it. So far so good though!
@balto I've got some friends that want to join me on  My username is bifflechips :).
I guess there's a new pope? Bad day to pick it. News overshadowed by Veronica Mars Kickstarter starting up &amp; Google Reader shutting down.
@toto I own it. Nice day for a walk, too.
Awesome, now Chicago just needs a Skyline Chili.
@toto I love messing with the sellers. I always ask what frites are, and after they explain say ...sooo fries then?
Awwww yeeee.
Woman in front of me at Starbucks just ordered 10 drinks, each as its own transaction.
I cannot express how much I hate the iTunes application for Windows.
This is reminiscent of the Love Actually gift wrapping scene.
Why is my already boxed Panera sandwich given to me in a large grocery bag?
@pluto Florence from Florence &amp; the Machine was discovered in a bathroom. This guy just needs exposure.
@snoopy He's just singing what we're all thinking.
Dude in the public restroom singing Mambo No. 5.
@rintintin Congrats! Your prize is 94 cents.
@lassie This particular one we stopped at on the way to Cincinnati ran out.
Arby's ran out of roast beef? Buh?
Buy 1 get 1 free drink at Starbucks? I'll have two Tall Pumpkin Spice Lattes in a Venti cup, please.
@dug Can you guys offer delivery where CAH isn't on the package? This is the third time I've failed to surprise my wife :(.
@dug Sap? Blackjack?
The vet just sent me a list of things that are dangerous to my pets, sung to the tune of These are a few of my favorite things.
Saw Skyfall last night, which was pretty cool. All of the high school kids at the Lake were not though.
@santoslhalper I received an invalid key for Battlefield 3 Premium. Support ticket  Could you please issue me a working key?
Testing days right before releases are so boring. I can't even FIX the bugs I find unless it's something breaking. Keep testing. Fix later.
@lassie I think Ursula the Hutt is more likely.
OH: It's work-safe, but the site LOOKS very communist.
In Central Park. Pretty sure I've seen all of it already on SVU.
@odie Enjoyed your seminar on Designing in Public. Picked up  but haven't gotten to play it yet. Love the look though.
Lunch is just something I do when I need a co-worker for something but they're out for lunch.
@balto I'd love to see everyone and meet Soren, but I'm still working out in Itasca. Raincheck, but say hey for me.
@hachiko @hachiko @hachiko @hachiko @hachiko @hachiko was just thinking about that, Ali's family was playing Draw Something.
Asked a co-worker which finger he uses to right-click and he flicked me off. Guess it's a touchy subject.
@clifford Ah, it's been bumped from worldwide for newer news.
@pluto Dunno what you're talking about. Guild Wars 2 Release Date is today's big news.
Giving labels proper names in a huge report, and I get to the Recall column in the Totals row.
This weekend I realized that movies never have very many sex jokes in them until you watch them with your parents.
OH: I have this person I'm supposed to call named Michael Scarn, but the phone number looks weird. It looks like a bogus one.
@snoopy You say that about everything.
@pluto That's cool. My suggestion was based on my first initials being KC. Some people would call me Casey when I was younger.
@rintintin Sadness. Are you guys not saying what it is for now? What about first letter? Might impact middle name choice.
@clifford Did you guys pick a first name?
@dug Suggest names like Taco Bell and Doritos, then names like Mal will seem awesome in comparison.
@toto Yeah! That's the guy I saw!
Saw my first shooting star and a wild turkey this weekend.
Just saw a bald eagle outside of a zoo for the first time in my life.
Driving to MI. Left lane closed in 2 miles and everyone is getting into the right lane now. Has to have some kind of scientific explanation.
@lassie I could outrun a centaur! Love your game, ArenaNet :).
@lassie I'll be sure to tell past me tomorrow so that he knows that I know that it is the life.
@balto Are you me from my future of exactly one day?
@marmaduke That would be awesome. Let's make it happen.
@rintintin Jealous. It's beta weekend for Guild Wars 2 and I'm at work. On the other hand, I do get to play some midnight whirlyball.
@eddie @eddie I look forward to the proof of knowing what everyone has ever thought. AMAZE ME, MIKE.
What's the deal with NBC shows and the name Kevin tonight? Must be payback for that George Takei voicemail from Community.
@balto Can't. I'm too busy CREATING.
@hachiko @hachiko OMG! I can't believe that just happened.
@odie Ah! I was thinking about that show last night, wondering when it was going to start. Thanks :).
Heads up, Avatar: The Legend of Korra starts tomorrow morning. Been a while since I got up for Saturday morning cartoons.
@lassie Scumbag Cthulhu. Claims to undo reality. Haunts a single house instead.
@toto It's cool, just cleansing houses of the animated corpses of previous tenants that are trying to lichify themselves. No biggie.
All of the players managed to survive our Call of Cthulhu game last night, and only two of them went insane. Temporarily.
Ran my first Call of Cthulhu game tonight and none of my players' characters went insane. I probably did it wrong.
@eddie In response to your 9,000th tweet, I'm sharing this comic with you:.
@eddie Irrelevant.
@clifford Nah, that's not it. Your body is just trying to tell you to preorder Guild Wars 2.
@rintintin Yes! I refused to finish the single player without 100% readiness. Engineer and Adept are my favorite. Also, Krogan headbutts!
@lassie Thank you for an awesome series! Mordin's storyline is my favorite. While I would prefer more closure, I still loved my ending.
@dug Thank you for the spoiler warning on today's news post. It is much appreciated.
@balto She's probably just embarrassed.
In all this Mass Effecting, I forgot to eat dinner. Classic me.
Beat Mass Effect 2 for the second time tonight. Maximum Renegade, maximum awesome.
@pluto Hah. I totally changed your tweet from P'owned to P'zoned with my mind.
Disaster Recovery Plan tested over the weekend. Disaster ensues on Monday. Caused by the Recovery Plan. What.
@balto Oh man, Justified is so good. It's only gotten better with each season, too.
@lassie @lassie I know, right?!
@eddie I think it's clear that you need to make a Pizza Hut Alliance, for trade agreement purposes.
@lassie Those are safe. That's what you should have ordered in the first place. Now I want a P'zone @lassie.
@eddie Well, you only have so much time. He'll know Operation Poisonzone failed when he doesn't see you in the Obituaries.
@marmaduke This was delivery? He knows where you live. You gotta get out of there!
@balto This sounds like a Seinfeld episode.
@lassie I hope this turns into a full scale  Manager starts buying up your favorite restaurants. Hangs NO BENS signs.
@scrappydoo Maybe you should just learn how to make calzones? I'll bet there's even a way to make them cold.
@clifford Here's my friend Kevin. He's really funny. Do something funny, Kevin. fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
@pluto It's too late. The joke's too obvious now :(.
@clifford I want to make a Muffin/Calzone man joke here, but I don't know if you've seen enough Arrested Development to get it.
@odie working on moving some devblog stuff over, I'll link ya when I can.
@rintintin Been working on a turn-based tactics game.
I just lost to my own AI. Not sure how I feel right now.
No idea how I missed a new Asteroids Galaxy Tour album. Happy weekend!
@hachiko I'm pretty sure Leonardo Da Vinci kept all of his crazy LEGO designs in a Moleskine.
@scrappydoo Pay your Comcast bill?
@dug I have watched all of the seasons that are on Netflix. It is excellent.
@snoopy Did not seem true to the series at all.
@odie I'm sure Juan hasn't seen it yet, but I'll say I wasn't happy with how it ended either.
@balto @balto  This is more of a winter solution  I was given the skully for christmas, to fit under my helmet.
At the D&D table: What do you mean I don't know the command word? I brute force it. Aardvark...
@scrappydoo In short: Google can share information about you with itself. Am I reading this wrong or is that it?
@pluto Oh man, I love freaking out Tux. Since his hair is longer, it covers up any kind of grip he could get with his paws.
@scoobydoo Ali's mom bought me the Tooks hat that fits under a helmet for xmas. Works pretty well. Nice find.
@santoslhalper sounds good to me. I want to take a road trip to Dayton in a few weeks, too. Eh, @santoslhalper.
NFL supports SOPA? Finally, a reason I can tell my family why I don't watch football and have them not look at me funny ...maybe.
Someone here just used the word grandpuppy. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
@lassie Cool, thanks a lot!
@lassie Thanks. Do you know what sizes your monitors are?
@marmaduke That sounds like a personal problem.
While testing Android voice apps, asked one What's the traffic like right now? and it showed me a picture of John Wayne.
@scoobydoo Hahaha, that's awesome. Sadly, I haven't had time to start book 3 yet.
Oh hey, look. Mass Effect 3 has a Collector's Edi...SOLD.
@lassie Get Battlefield 3, duh.
@pluto Spoilers: it's awesome.
@eddie Looks like google reader syncing is currently broken because of the update, but hopefully that will get fixed soon.
@odie haha, I JUST got to that website when I saw your message pop up.
I've about had it with Google Reader. What are other people using as their (non-Apple-only) RSS reader?
@pluto Shift+Tab :P.
@clifford Relevant: PLEASE make the defibrillator less of a pain to kill with? People won't wait around for me to shock them to death.
@balto @balto It's like we're 40-year-olds and Google just shut down Usenet.
@odie But I agree, it's dumb if I have to +1 something first before I share it. I share too many dumb things that don't deserve +1.
@rintintin I'm guessing there's a Share with Google Plus! one out or coming soon.
@lassie I dunno, but all of your followers who also follow me do now (but I doubt they didn't already know that).
@clifford You have to +1 it, then you can share it on Google Plus. I've got you guys in your own Circle. I don't like it, But it works.
@scrappydoo They've dubbed that feature  subscription export.
@balto I know, and the font got a little bigger (unless I was using an extension for that, which is now broken).
Oh. I get it. This is their way of encouraging me to use Google+.
Google Reader just updated, and now I'm not finding Shared Items anywhere @hachiko My shares. You has them. But where are they?
@clifford trying to fly a helicopter with mouse and keyboard is horrible.
Operation Battlefield-3-Weekend Status: Success. Secondary Objective: Flight Training. Status: Failure. Joystick inbound.
@marmaduke Engineers are hanging out of helicopters repairing them. Impossible to take them down, even if disabled. Please fix this.
@lassie oh man, that's tough. I'd probably go with the PS3 version if that's where you can play with people you know. Squad up!
@dug I'm addicted. It looks amazing on my PC, and I'm a sucker for a strategic squad-based FPS.
Last person just left the office. Be advised, Battlefield 3 weekend has begun.
Sent the bug back telling them it won't be a problem for almost 8000 years. Debated setting the status to On Hold.
Upload breaks when I enter 4/3/17989 for the expiration date [sic]. Does it, QA? DOES IT?!
@toto I assumed this was the case.
@rintintin You've made a huge mistake.
Friday afternoon fire drill. At least it's not raining.
Comcast put me on TriplePlay +$15 to bill. Didn't want Phone -&gt; didn't complete 3rd party agreement -&gt; not getting charged. Bill cut in half.
Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Scones, Pumpkin Pie, Dogfish Head Punkin Ale... I love Fall.
@toto I think Comcast is a stupid company that sucks, but switched from AT&T after I had basically the exact same problem as you.
@dug Was on the phone w/ Comcast all weekend. Somehow out of that they managed to make my bill go up $15. Called too late to fix today.
@pluto That's ridiculous, you loved Fuego Loco!
@santoslhalper This is just about what name both go under, isn't it? Streaming and DVD are still separate plans, if I'm not being dumb.
@scrappydoo Haha, awesome! You have a gym near you or is this outdoors?
Shamelessly stolen idea from @eddie.
@clifford I wasn't saying e-ink as opposed to actual books. Nook and Kindle both have a color tablet version now.
@marmaduke Your biggest question is, if you want to get the current generation of either one, is free 3G important to you?
@eddie Are you looking at just e-ink?
@balto Getting married is so 2-3 weeks ago.
@clifford @clifford @clifford It's dericious. Get some.
@toto Then why didn't they pick a better twitter name.
@odie @odie @odie tell me how the Arctic Panzer Wolf is, wherever that stupid bar is.
@odie I tried to get some Arctic Panzer Wolf from a place that had it on tap, but they had just run out. Let me know how it is.
California store told me b/c I live in Chicago, It takes 5 days to ship to East Coast. I guess it's East Coast if it doesn't touch Pacific.
@balto  Does not seem like the time to suggest a twitter account.
@snoopy A Wendy's basement? Only reason I can think of for being there is you were all abducted by a crazy manager...
@balto 5 people, but last night 2 of us also hopped in on our Android phones while being logged in on our computers, so 7.
@toto I can't make the hangout, but some friends and I have been using Hangouts to play D&D from 3 different states (usually 5 of us).
@scrappydoo Oh no! It's not a secret anymore!
Why didn't anyone tell me it was International Talk Like a Pirate Day?!
Received compliments on my shirt leaving O'Hare and SFO. I'm clearly more fashionable than @eddie would ever admit.
Kaboom, married! (yesterday).
@dug noob.
hog trough dance? wtf weddings?!
@santoslhalper I am excited for upcoming hoodie weather.
Under my Jones Soda cap: By next month, your responsibilities will be alleviated.
@lassie Depends on the tip :P.
@clifford At some point the cheese level gets pretty ridiculous, but it comes back down. Excited for the new season.
@balto Psych also came out before Dexter.
@clifford Been a while since I saw the 1st season. It's more a procedural show than about Shawn's character development.
@santoslhalper I'm not sure why 3 is a reason the show isn't awesome. Is it because it's not Dexter?
@balto Do they actually believe he's psychic in the first season? I thought the police are just ok with it because he gets results.
@scrappydoo Do you have webcams in Texas?
@eddie @eddie  I hated Monk but I love Psych.
@hachiko That show is awesome. If I were a few years older, it'd be even better because I'd understand more of their weird references.
@toto That's awesome! I love their books (and Rails!).
@scrappydoo There is, but I didn't have the time to stop over there this morning.
The office coffee tastes a little soapy today. Sadly, this is an improvement.
@marmaduke D&D duh.
@clifford No, you always expect I'm out to get you guys when I'm DMing.
@balto As the main offender, you would. :P.
@dug When it's understood between the players and myself as the GM that we're on the same side, we tend to have a lot more fun.
@scrappydoo Remember that you are playing alongside your party, not against them :P.
@hachiko If you've got any questions, I would be happy to try to answer them. I can write down tips as they come to mind during games, too.
@santoslhalper @santoslhalper I know, right? I showed him how to play over a year ago.
How was work today, sweetie? It was great. I indented 8000 lines of text.
Someone nearby is repeatedly making the same three keystrokes. That same someone needs to learn how to use macros.
@hachiko @hachiko Mmm, Urgot Choffee.
@hachiko Tell your dad to quit drinking water and start drinking coffee.
@lassie Lawful Good is best good.
The best time to have an Amazon Prime membership is when your AC breaks. Would you like to spend $4 to have it by tomorrow? Duh.
@scoobydoo did you tell her where she could pick up her Darwin award?
@balto were you retweeted on anyone's public timeline?
On the plus side, I think we found our Wedding DJ this weekend.
@snoopy This has been a problem with the electricity in our apartment since the summer started. I e-mailed the landlord about it.
@hachiko Leverage isn't on the DVR, so the power went out before last night.
24 hours and a new car later, we're finally home to find our power went out while we were gone. Greeted by a lack of AC and some angry cats.
@marmaduke It's a newer version of @marmaduke 's car. Thanks for the recommendation Juan :).
What a day. Looks like we're buying a new car.
Car broke down on the way back to Chicago. Staying in a hotel for tonight. Hopefully we can get it fixed and head home tomorrow.
@santoslhalper you finally get a new apartment?
@balto Top reason to use Google+: It's not Facebook.
@pluto Or not.
Played the Arkham Horror board game for the first time last night. We did not finish, but we know the rules now. I liked it a lot.
@eddie @eddie Finally unlocked Unstoppable Wizard last night.
@scoobydoo Ali got so angry at me the other day when I forgot to eat. She's just jelly of my sweet body.
@rintintin @rintintin But Chris was on the winning team. Now the text is inconsistent with the result of the game.
@hachiko Needed to populate a relationship table between two tables who's rows were initially all related to each other.
Three and a half years after graduating, I used a cross join for the first time today.
@pluto @pluto @pluto @pluto The 2nd is best for me as well. In town for sure that weekend.
@marmaduke I'm actually in town the next two weekends, so that would work. Been going out of town a lot lately for wedding planning.
@scoobydoo Plays really well. I'm still working out past O'Hare, so I'd only be able to make it in to the city after the workday.
@lassie so many parts of your world.
Just downloaded  on my new EVO 3D. My first purchase. :) @scoobydoo @scoobydoo.
@marmaduke relevant:.
@santoslhalper Sorry, seems like it's more serious than I first thought :( Is it your practice space?
@eddie Don't you mean grimy? :P.
@eddie How I Met Your Mother season finale SO GOOD.
@eddie Buying one for a friend, will I get two posters if I have two pre-orders in my cart?
Rarely happens, but I love adding comments after the continue condition for a loop that needs to run exactly 3 times. i &lt;3:.
@balto @balto That is clearly a hypocritical troll.
@balto But it isn't really instant. If you know what you're searching for, are you not typing fast enough?
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo tweeted an explanation, so I wasn't sure.
@snoopy @snoopy And just to be clear, you are aware it was a joke, yeah?
@santoslhalper What do you not like about Instant?
@odie Agreed. Mr. T is from Chicago, after all. And Boeing's in Seattle. Where my location-based searching at, Google??
The Konami Code on google.com gives me Boeing's stock price. Not a very good easter egg, in my opinion.
@marmaduke Hahaha, sounds like he was trolling all of his followers.
@odie Oh, I'm so sorry. How did those get in there? In this next slide...
Ali told me to quit trolling her whole family. I told her no you. Then I fixed all of their computers.
@balto @balto duh.
@dug To find more and better coffee?
@lassie @lassie @lassie  Wow, were you guys up early for the rapture?
@eddie How do you get newer evidence for bible-based calculations?
It's New Laptop Day, which makes me happy. Unfortunately, it's also Learn New Keyboard Day, which makes me sad.
@marmaduke I'm sure they're going to just claim to be bad at math.
@rintintin Are you trying to convince me to go to church? Because it's working.
@pluto It's just a viral marketing campaign. They found out their JESUS IS REAL. REPENT. billboards/barns weren't very effective.
@toto You had creativity over me at least :P.
@lassie @lassie  patented inb4mike.
@odie That's just flavor germs.
@clifford Always hold out for Section 9. Right, @clifford ?
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo The trick is to ask it this way: What, specifically, are we forgetting?
Sad that Pixar went with Cars to do a sequel this year instead of The Incredibles. On the other hand, Bruce Campbell voices a new character.
@eddie *shrug* Have to handle it somewhere, and it's programmer's preference.
@pluto That's why you have a hidden field with the same name set to False.
@lassie Landscape feels more comfortable, and I make fewer mistakes.
@dug Can we get a Double Trouble Trundle/Rumble Double Double Bundle?
@pluto Did you beat the Elite Four?!
@eddie I don't see a problem with that.
@rintintin That's because it's his dad.
@hachiko you forgot the hashtag.
@toto Hah, they're alright. I need to get back to that series. I branched into the Cleric Quintet at some point.
@dug yeah, it helps me align my chakras.
@scoobydoo never unprotect your tweets.
Bug: Javascript error for users that have apostrophes in their name. Workaround: Fire all Irish and Elven employees.
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo @scoobydoo I rolled a 4. The Cylons won.
@balto We only had 3 people, and I was Gaius, so as soon as someone became a Cylon in the sleeper phase I knew. Threw him in the brig.
Played the BSG board game for the 1st time tonight. Entire thing came down to one roll on a d8 with a 50% chance of humans or cylons winning.
Alright, Amazon seems to be confused as to what a Dune Buggy is, and what a Go-Kart is. CHALLENGE PREVENTED.
Ali just bet me that I *wouldn't* put a Dune Buggy on our Registry. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
@scoobydoo I'm going to have to write a script that filters that out of her browser until she gets her own 3DS.
@hachiko Yeah, if Ali didn't play so much Zelda all the time, I'd feel burned by the Wii. I can at least trade my DSLite for credit to 3DS.
I'm going to play lots of @balto  tonight so Portal 2 releases sooner, and I can stop having to listen to people talk about it sooner.
@balto They've also got a DSi mode, still in beta I think, but gives supported games more CPU & memory, smoother and better FPS.
@balto I have no intention of using the 3D. That's probably because of the upscale for the screen res.
@santoslhalper I saw you tried out the 3DS, what did you think? I'm considering picking one up. My DSLite is dying and I want WPA2 compatibility.
@scoobydoo You're right. You'll never get another chance, because you'll never go back to Boston Stoker. Ever. Also, time zones and work.
@eddie Are you referring to the 3DS or that their next-gen console will actually be more powerful than current-gen consoles?
@lassie Quick! Write The cake is a lie over everything.
@scrappydoo @scrappydoo Don't you mean *an* irony?
@scrappydoo I hope all of the emails you received were about the bug tracker's mailer being broken. That would be so coincidental.
@eddie Trance is the better one in my opinion. House is too noisy, dance is too distracting.
@santoslhalper I've started using a last.fm station with keyword dubstep.
@lassie @lassie It was a quote from our D&D game tonight.
Worst comes to worst, we become vampires and get sweet powers.
@santoslhalper The tweet after that is the one that makes me sad :(.
@balto @balto Tear wraps?
@santoslhalper Because not all apps go free.
@scrappydoo I think most apps are cheaper there everyday than in the android market.
@odie Ali's cousin was practically laughing when he explained it to me.
@rintintin All are forgiven except loss of interest in Castle.
@dug Was hoping there was an episode of Fringe on friday that DVRed. Sadly, there wasn't :(.
@clifford Hah, thanks for reminding me I need to watch the rest of Party Down :P.
@clifford @clifford Convincing? Sounds good to me.
@eddie @eddie @eddie I've only seen the first two episodes of Party Down, so I can't comment on how alike they are.
@balto It was never a show I thought I would like, but a friend recommended it. Now I wish there was more.
@marmaduke @marmaduke Veronica Mars is three seasons and created by the same people who did Party Down. Ali and I liked it a lot.
@snoopy I imagine that would be a bit unwieldy.
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo I'm surprised @scoobydoo hasn't jumped in to say lol DayAir rulez! u noobs! :P.
@odie I got an email about mine being compromised too. Have all of your emails been about the same provider?
@eddie I knew true happiness last night.
@snoopy ...browser-based Web surfing. o_O.
@balto Yeeeeeeeeeeeee.
@scrappydoo Awesome. Weaksauce. C'mon.
@lassie What starter? How many badges? Pokedex count?
@scoobydoo I can understand that. But you don't want to play pokemon? wat?
@toto I am proud to say that I have never been to New Jersey.
@eddie Worst layover ever?
@santoslhalper I love that website. Ali got this one for me a while back.
Just got back from seeing The Adjustment Bureau with @odie Loved it.
@hachiko Lookin' sick and sexy-fied.
@snoopy Got that glitter on my eyes.
Kevin, is Pikachu famous? (Ali's younger cousin).
@santoslhalper Oh wow. I can usually handle half of one before I feel full.
@balto Oh man. I can't remember which one's were my favorite, but I think Peanut Butter or Cream Cheese sounds right.
@santoslhalper Are you saying you've never had Killer Brownies before? :(.
@dug @dug Juan knows how to set a scene with hashtags. It's romantic, really.
@scoobydoo both of those things &gt; poor hash tag use.
@santoslhalper I fail to see what your last tweet has to do with the hit NBC show Community.
@clifford I can't find the map this forum post refers to, even though I'm an Insider. Would love help finding it!
Fixed our toilet with a keychain ring.
@marmaduke Agreed! Gouda taim!
@marmaduke When did I say it was bad? Cheesy != Bad.
@rintintin I have. It's alright. It's not quite as cheesy as Chuck. The bad guys haven't been as cool as I had hoped they'd be.
@clifford @clifford.
@pluto It did shut me down for 1 1/2 days. I sunk to the level of thievery though.
@rintintin I managed to make it out of my parking spot this morning by stealing the neighbor's shovel & replacing it before they woke up.
@lassie @lassie my office is closed tomorrow, so I have to take the day off. shazbot.
@dug Warwick and feeder?
@pluto I still prefer the first, self-titled album, but Pow Pow is a great track.
@snoopy I'd like to know where you got the Nice Tweets shirt!
@balto That'd be one awesome goat, though.
@dug The drive in wasn't that bad. I have a work meeting after I finish at the client (but it can start w/o me), so no big deal.
@santoslhalper All the snow is in Chicago. All of it.
@odie Oh man, True Grit was awesome. Enjoy!
Been using jQuery more than .NET on my current project lately. Hooray! Programming is fun again!
@hachiko You've already played more than twice as many games as I have. I can't keep up!
@scoobydoo A powerful masculine voice whispered sweet updates of my pizza to me while I waited, too.
Good news everyone! The Domino's pizza tracker has added themes! I tracked my pizza using the bollywood theme.
@clifford Agreed. Fix them, @clifford.
@balto Were you wearing a brojacket like @balto or a pair of Broakleys(tm)?
@dug @dug agreed. why?
Finally have a comfortable chair at work. Whenever someone leaves at this client, everyone hits his desk like vultures.
Burn Notice season finale was amazing.
Watched all of Toy Story 3 without tearing up. Today I am a man.
@snoopy LIKE A BOSS.
@clifford typical wednesday night.
@marmaduke blegh, didn't see that you won the kindle. ...what I actually meant was Congratulations, winner!
@rintintin so get a Nook?
@clifford Yesss. Good answer. @clifford.
@marmaduke Why did you wake up at 4AM? You better not have started playing WoW again.
Christmas Tree!
@toto How far did you get in your NaNoWriMo this year?
@scoobydoo I like both. We'll have to check the google doc.
@lassie @lassie when are we making our dinomite/mart-force/cyberzombie game?
@scoobydoo So does the Nook. I have the same crappy phone data service that you have, but for free!
@santoslhalper @santoslhalper Bought. Will go into pile of things to eventually play once at some point.
@snoopy Your turn again for the game, you still busy? What do?
@rintintin Just finished it. Awesome episode :).
@pluto Was it really that bad? I thought it was awesome when he ended his final show by telling people not to be cynical.
@balto This happened to me too. I'm already looking for a new place to go for lunch today.
Ah! Merged the last 6 months of work back into the main branch in an hour. Amazing. Having trouble deciding if that's a good or bad sign.
@lassie Playing D&D helps me.
@hachiko Work's been stressful lately. Need something to keep my mind occupied.
@scrappydoo The Kirby Dance always helps.
@marmaduke @marmaduke @marmaduke @marmaduke I'm ready to play Dark Sun to help keep me sane. Get your characters up :P.
Just realized I've been sitting here for two hours with my earbuds in, listening to NOTHING.
@marmaduke There's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes those are the best names.
@lassie What are you talking about? Jim Thunderbrow is classic.
Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear live stream:.
@dug Sounds like fun. Just need to find a time I can make it downtown during the week, or a time in OP.
@santoslhalper I'm not a parent, so I probably just don't understand. She was also taking pictures and sending them to her sister. Normal?
This real friday is much better than yesterday's fake friday.
Anyone who can deliver me George Takei's voicemail message from tonight's Community episode gets my eternal gratitude.
Why are gov't warnings on beer qualified with According to the Surgeon General...? As if someone's going to say Pfft, what does he know?
@rintintin Dual crossbow wielding is gonna be aaaaawesoooome.
Someone is shooting nails into the ceiling directly beneath my desk chair. Least comfortable work day ever.
@snoopy @snoopy Denying being a hipster is a clear sign of being a hipster.
@pluto @pluto So you're saying they WEREN'T hipsters, then?
@dug @dug Why were you across the street?
@santoslhalper Why did you buy a didgeridoo?
Finally playing some  tonight. It's been too long.
@dug Only cool if you said Return from whence you came as you threw them. Otherwise, you're a littering asshole.
@toto Time Crisis! That list is almost 50% fighters, though.
@odie Are you at a computer science convention in Puerto Rico?
@snoopy.
@marmaduke Joy Yee's Noodles in Chinatown.
Wow. This is the biggest bowl of Udon I've ever seen.
I was woken up today by a man cutting the street with a massive circular saw.
If you don't want to receive phone calls from us, you must provide us with the home telephone number we should not contact.
Can't believe no one has wished me a happy programmer's day today.
@snoopy Snow's not as bad. And the voice actor is the same as the main human in GW2!
@lassie Hope sucks.
@santoslhalper @santoslhalper GUIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLDDDDDD WAAAAAAAARRRRRS!
@balto @balto Any word on when the store will be back up? My bday is soon, I'd rather my family bought from you than through Amazon.
@clifford Too late. Twitter's over. You missed it.
Played the drums on my desk for about 5 minutes before I even realized it. Sorry everyone in my cube area.
@dug I had one of those. My idea that someone else already thought of  Think Matt was the one that showed me.
@rintintin If I were the one creating the stylesheets, I'd understand. It's because I'm using 3rd party stuff that does it that I'm angrified.
You can create up to 31 styleSheet objects with createStyleSheet method. The method then returns an Invalid Argument exception What? WHY.
@lassie That is the hobo's version of a slick.
Client is telling me to store a 30 megabyte file in SQL session state, a result of having to click too many times on the page. Kill me.
@clifford I have never gotten mine to work properly, either. No idea why this hasn't been fixed.
@pluto @pluto @pluto @pluto (did you take AT, Ben?) and I are offended.
@odie @odie I'm with Sarah. Nothing to climb but buildings around here.
Net Neutrality's main opposition is complete ignorance on the subject.
Tea Party came out against Net Neutrality b/c it's more gov't regulation, saying Net Neutrality thwarts free speech rights of ISPs. FFS.
@balto @balto had the CySurg implant cameras in his cat's eyes before he left. Don't go to the bathroom.
@rintintin Well, if you're mostly just planning to play at home, FFXIII might be the better choice (and cheaper, apparently).
@snoopy that's a good point. think you'll be playing more at home or out and about as well?
@pluto The intro to FFXIII is about half of the game. It's completely linear, but I still enjoyed it (the ~25 hours I played).
@pluto If you have a LOT of time to kill, FFXIII. If you want to jump in, and not have to deal with crappy characters like Hope, DQIX.
@pluto all typical cat behavior, from my experience.
Picked up the 1st volume of Chew before I left San Francisco. Read it all on the flight and loved it. Now I have to order Volume 2.
@scrappydoo Hah! Boston Stoker was my guess before I checked the picture from the Dayton Airport.
@eddie @eddie @eddie I'm planning on making it out to Dayton Aug. 20-22. Bug Mike enough and he might come, too.
@clifford @clifford @clifford @clifford Noddin' my head like yeaaah. Movin' my hips like yeaaah.
@santoslhalper why are you at a starbucks?
@rintintin Congrats from the west coast! We'll be drinking already, but I'll raise my beer in a silent toast.
Finally found some single color origami sheet packs in Japantown.
@hachiko I picked it up when it first dropped, but the drawer interface bothered me. It's much better now. Only complaint is twitpic use.
My safety gets in the way of all of my fun.
Waiting for checked baggage is really cramping my style.
@clifford @clifford I read everything in my own narcissistic voice.
Loving this Automata storyline. Great job Ben Caldwell @santoslhalper @santoslhalper @santoslhalper.
@marmaduke Holy crap, these are the best pens I have ever used in my life  This must be my oddest sincere tweet ever.
@clifford  l2search GOD.
People keep joining this conference call every 5 seconds. Performance levels are at an all-time *BEEP-BLOOP*.
I hope this is done before my birthday. I& like to go home by October.
My only knowledge of Mad Men is that one of the guest stars from 30 Rock is in it and.
@eddie Awesome! I'm excited. I'd like to see some Sam Axe character development.
@eddie @eddie Personally, I feel it needs more, gruesome deaths. I'll still be picking it up tonight, though.
@scrappydoo Haven't tried that with my 360 yet. Odds are one of us will know what we're doing.
@eddie Ah, well here's my spoiler-free review: Awesome.
@santoslhalper @santoslhalper and I grabbed the last volume and finished it yesterday. What'd you think?
@hachiko @hachiko @hachiko Sounds good to me. Large bet on myself in versus mode.
@marmaduke Bar graphs kill people.
@odie What about a bar graph that says Yes 100% to the question Do bar graphs lie?
Would love to get the new Chicane album. Physical CD is sold out on Amazon, and none of the MP3 stores have it.
@snoopy What did you think of the person with an iPad?
@rintintin See Pirates of Silicon Valley.
@santoslhalper You make a better Steve Jobs than Noah Wyle ever did.
@hachiko That was my impression as well, until Gizmodo's quote from Steve Jobs said differently.
If the newest iPhone update fixes the antenna, why the free case?
Congrats to iPhone 4 owners, they just won a free case!
@snoopy You are in for a treat.
Inception was awesome.
Apparently my tweet about the blinds in Leverage last night made a blogger for curtains follow me. LOOKING AT YOU @odie.
Offices in  always have quick-pull style blinds. Guess it's better than actors slowly turning a plastic thing as it squeaks em shut.
My dog's name is going to be Megabyte.
@marmaduke Same here. Intentionally avoided the first 90 seconds video that was floating around so it's more exciting tonight.
I need to start storing an inflatable raft in my car, so I can get to the apartment from my parking spot. That or, you know, boots.
How much rain does it take to sink Chicago?
@scoobydoo I can't deny the cornhole/anus relation. Most people will attribute the game to Cincinnati, and while stupid, use their name.
My mom (a teacher) played World of Warcraft for a class she's taking. Asked her if the class was sponsored by Blizzard. Her reply: What?
@clifford I guess if you want to call Cincinnati Way down south. I always get funny looks when I ask people what they mean by Bags.
@eddie Stella's sister :P.
Completely unrelated: Anyone in the market for a used '95 Chevrolet Beretta? Recently replaced coolant Like New!
@odie We brought up @odie Saturn SL2. Classy.
Finally, my personal favorite: When I make a slight left turn, the car won't shift into neutral.
When I release the brake & hit the accelerator, the brakes won't stick, causing my car to pounce forward.
I'll be able to relax in air conditioning that works, instead of driving on the highway with the windows down.
I'll be able to see if cars are coming in the driver's side mirror instead of having to jerk my neck to look.
@rintintin I'll collaborate (and listen) with @rintintin.
Once I'm in the car, I won't need to pop the hood to replace the coolant that leaked out during the workday.
When I leave work today, I will be getting into my car from the driver's side door, not the passenger side.
@dug @dug of course this is blocked where I work.  :( please record!
@eddie is it still out in oak park? We had to leave for Cincinnati friday night :(.
I'm finally moving to a new cubicle, away from the people talk about their dogs all day. Productivity just went up a million billion percent.
I wish the person I'm working with was taller. He's never in his cubicle, but I can never tell.
@balto I don't think I'd do any of those things on a Saturday and probably not a Sunday (haven't had to go to church in a long time).
@clifford saw an ad on the El where a fast food place had partnered with Mafia Wars on FB. You get a free mafia thing with your food :(.
@lassie I got it for $10 off, which I would say was definitely worth it. I hate the GTAs but I like RDR. Nothing revolutionary, but fun.
@balto So what's your opinion on the Evo after a day or so?
Successfully herded baby bunny away from traffic, back into the apartment courtyard. Herding cattle in Red Dead Redemption all day paid off.
@santoslhalper I couldn't stop myself. Intentionally misinterpreting questions is too funny to me. Real answer: *shrug*.
@odie I guess so, what's the offensive term you're avoiding?
@rintintin Now quick, root it and install Froyo so it's even FASTER.
@odie That means you'll have good luck today!
Horrible traffic driving home. Decided to stop in Elmhurst for BW's & Jamba Juice. Hooray.
@scoobydoo The comics are good, too! The sixth (and final) one comes out soon.
@snoopy that last crash? Right in front of us. I almost caught a piece of debris.
@balto we just sat down. Have you seen @balto yet?
@snoopy we're tailgating now, gonna be somewhere near turn 1. I'm told we'll have a good view of the high-probability crash area.
@pluto I'm going to be there too for some reason.  Where will you be?
@toto I bet waiting in line at our post office is worse today.
@balto @balto Get back to work.
Cubs players get paid to deal with fans more than they do to play baseball.
Finally found a spot at my desk that gets my phone good enough reception to listen to  all day.
@odie Someone should tell him his strings are upside down.
In a productive mood today, but I'm stuck watching status bars while setting up an environment for a new work project.
C'mon, Microsoft. You're killing me.
No time for lunch outside to read Scott Pilgrim :( Maybe tomorrow.
@scoobydoo Hoodie. It's been between 60-80F last few weeks.
@marmaduke Congratulations on the engagement! Missed this over the weekend.
Nantucket Necatars under the cap: Nantucket is not a part of Kentucky. Now they are just getting lazy.
@pluto That's understandable.
@marmaduke Apparently he's bumping George Lopez to midnight. I would say it's irony, but in this case no one likes the George Lopez show.
@marmaduke How can they call it breaking news if Conan already broke the story?
@pluto Only an idiot would come back looking like himself. If you met, you'd either go into shock or create a time paradox.
@hachiko Maybe they were separate copies of you from the future.
@rintintin I leave a note on my fridge.
@toto YouTube needs an Auto DJ.
Free cone day at Ben & Jerry's! (between noon & 8PM).
OH at the office Do you think it's possible for a printer to get bogged down with, like, cookies?
@rintintin come to chicago, bookstores know to stock rpgs here.  yes that's a pokedex next to pathfinder core.
@ all my Emmis friends:  Practice for next season?
@scoobydoo I had that same revelation last year. Isn't it AMAZING?
Big Lebowski Alignment Chart (possibly NSFW).
@toto from what I've heard, you usually don't see it again after the first rrod.
@rintintin I got mine back in 2 weeks. Mine just red-ringed last month.
@lassie You mean Lexii?
Back from Arizona, and I brought a cold with me :(.
@hachiko good call, it is :) we have plenty of pictures of us looking silly.
I'm higher up than you are!
We killed the world!
Asia is about to asplode.
There are a lot of rules for Pandemic that follow the form If ______, the game immediately ends in defeat for all players.
@dug The lead falls were so we get used to falling. I don't think I was supposed to get that close to the ground though.
Took my first lead climbing practice fall today, as did @balto I stopped inches from the ground. Epic.
Cyclist almost hit me & gave me a stare like I was at fault: I was parked getting into my car. You were moving. Handlebars are for steering.
Hate the people at UPS who stand at the counter in front of everyone sitting patiently. Love the UPS workers that ignore them.
@odie It's just that old.
I must be the only person in this building that drinks Mountain Dew (sometimes). My can has an ad for a movie that came out June 2009.
Someone I don't know from Columbus just butt-dialed me. Hi butt!
@rintintin Chicago has a suburb that is bigger than Dayton.
@eddie I guess they haven't heard of the Pre in Dayton.
Longest Friday ever.
Sorry if you received an e-mail from me about Google Buzz. Not sure why it's automatically e-mailing people.
@scoobydoo I have the same problem plus a redringed 360 currently residing at Microsoft. I had my fiance hide Mass Effect 2 in the meantime.
@eddie @eddie I haven't been craving coffee, either. Although if Boston Stoker ever opens up in Chicago, I'm doomed.
@eddie I read the end of the Death Note manga last night. It sucked just a little less than the anime.
@lassie pics or bearcat isn't real anymore.
The woman at UPS said they get about 4 or 5 red-ringed 360s to ship to Microsoft for repair EVERY DAY.
@scrappydoo I already had Mass Effect 1 for the 360. From what I saw of the PC version, I preferred it on the 360, reverse of Dragon Age.
@marmaduke I am all out of timedogs. TIMETUX NOOOOOO.
Blegh. My 360 finally red-ringed on me today. I ordered Mass Effect 2 two days ago. I hope the box art is good? At least the repair is free.
@santoslhalper Depends. Is that plate across from you the person you're sharing it with? Then no :P.
I'm not sure why the maintenance crew needs a hammer to paint our apartment hallway.
@snoopy I don't get it. It's a big version of an iPod that costs more than my netbook, but is capable of less.
@rintintin You somehow manage to login and actually do something on the days that the CPU usage peaks.
@marmaduke Usually Sundays. Working on a webapp that has a mixed play-by-post/play-by-chat dynamic for continuous play throughout the week.
@rintintin I have a feeling Google is less concerned about it than I am.
@eddie Google's webmaster tools is telling me to compress the google analytics javascript hosted by google to save 13KB.
@balto Why do some people put way too much lime in Guacamole? Blegh.
Finally started watching Battlestar Galactica this weekend. Can't... stop...
Damn you domino's pizza tracker! A 10 topping limit is too low. It is not for my pizza's own good.
@clifford If you can do it on command, you should make Are you having fun yet? the trigger words.
@clifford There is always one guy who does it. Anyplace you work, there is always one guy. And it kills me :&lt;.
I'm usually pretty good at finding the silver lining on busy days like today, until I hear my biggest pet peeve Are you having fun yet?
On a business conference call and if you want to call me baby, just go ahead now randomly started playing on the line. Best call ever.
1992: I'm not going to do some little happy hour from Omaha at 12:30 Leno said.
@scrappydoo Burn Notice is still my favorite show. Cannot wait.
@lassie Hah! I thought the premiere was alright. Monday's episode was much better.
I waited my entire childhood for Conan to take over the Tonight Show. Don't take it back.
.@scrappydoo Stop messing with episode order in your shows. A dead character was alive in Fringe tonight. Ridiculous.
@toto I assume you meant tangy zip?
@pluto I was back at work :( I'm telling them I'm allergic from now on. Maybe if they think I'll die they might remember.
Jimmy Johns Don't give me mayonnaise when I say no mayonnaise. It defiles your otherwise delicious sandwiches.
@eddie why is my christmas present all over your car windows?
@marmaduke I couldn't stop laughing at it. Reminded me of Boris in Snatch. We ended up using an old blanket to carry it.
@scrappydoo Just put a bag over it to catch the needles. Like this?!
@balto NOO! No more focaccia sandwiches and awesome gelato. :(.
@hachiko I hate sticker rash.
@snoopy Is that your belated Christmas gift to me?
@scrappydoo Last time I used it, it jumped from cooking to delivered and we didn't actually have our pizza.
@toto Do you need a picture of Tux for reference?
@santoslhalper Pics or didn't happen.
Suffered from Phantom Cat Syndrome the whole time we were at my parents' house.
@clifford it's a goddamn epidemic.
@balto I imagine the 2 and the 1 will be offset to the top left of the zeros. What did people do in the 1970's without loops?
@odie I do the same thing, and I feel like I'm competing against store owners for politeness when I buy things from them.
@santoslhalper Exquisite.
Our REAL pizza is here. We got 2 free sprites and they made a large instead of a medium, as if they knew this would happen. Apology accepted.
It got here, but it's not our pizza. Didn't notice until delivery guy was gone. Why do you give in to nostalgia, Kevin?
My pizza is on its way. Will let you know of future updates.
I wasn't attentive enough to the pizza tracker to livetweet my pizza status. It's already being boxed.
Watching the status of my pizza on dominos.com. I know it's weird to order domino's in Chicago but I've only had it once since college.
Finally fixed our leaky bathroom sink.
@pluto We are pretty popular twitter personalities.
@santoslhalper That sounds like this is the perfect game for you:.
@santoslhalper Requisition for proper forms to submit request for clemency has been denied.
@scoobydoo pics or it didn't happen.
@clifford Another friend of mine has actually been using freemind for work for a while and always raved about it.
I swear those lines weren't there this morning!
@santoslhalper Agreed, you should pick up DMing again.
@eddie Did you at least wear a condom?
@scrappydoo I think your syllabus should just say LAMP in landscape.
@hachiko Except for the SQL part.
@rintintin Sounds more like they'd be studying to be a designer than a developer.
Got my first REAL Christmas tree today with @clifford :).
@scoobydoo And yet still one day closer to being dead!
@rintintin I didn't know they were leaving/had left. How'd they handle the characters leaving in the plot?
@santoslhalper omg that narwhal can talk!
@toto Are you saying some new breed of polar bees has taken over the school? You're all doomed! Dooooooooomed!
Just found this, of which I am apparently a source. I'll have to go through my tweets to remember what I contributed :P.
Best part of getting back inside my apartment: pumpkin pie in the fridge.
Got back to Chicago at 12:45AM to find a new door on our apartment. And new locks. And no new key.  @balto & @balto.
@hachiko Pumpkin pie for breakfast! Woo!
@odie Christmas or winter? I've had the winter, and it's quite good, like all of Bell's  stuff.
When people accidentally leave out words in emails, it makes them sound like a pirate-There be lots of dessert at the meeting!
@snoopy @snoopy Was the Behir's Lightning Breath supposed to be included in today's errata? My party is still dazed :P.
It's true. I am a corporate puppet.
Retweet this message to help unlock an exclusive Xbox LIVE item for Final Fantasy XIII.
@balto Then you are doing it wrong.
@rintintin Is it called Left Hand Imperial Stout specifically because it is for drinking with another beer in the right?
@scrappydoo Thanks. I earned that.
@eddie JoP needs more twitter.
@eddie Awesome! Glad you like it, too. @eddie was the only other person who I knew had heard it. I think On Directing is my favorite.
My first week as a tech lead is almost up and no one has died yet. Sooo I think it's going pretty well.
Glad I have a new Tegan & Sara album to keep me company while I have to work tonight :/.
@pluto A little out of my price range. How about a javascript map? :P.
@clifford Ah, it's been a while since I've seen the original. Was the last one supposed to be a political commentary, too?
@snoopy Really? Did they let you know that they were lizard people?
@rintintin That is probably because J. J. Abrams wasn't involved.
@dug I also don't remember them giving away the aliens were bad in the first episode.
@santoslhalper You're talking about... Universal health care?! I thought it was pretty bad. Nothing like the old one.
@clifford Why does Beast look so stupid.
.@rintintin No, PC has custom stuff like mouse control, text chat in game, and graphics settings. You're kiddng, right? Ridiculous.
@rintintin That's how Ali and I spent the first 4 hours of ours, only it was the whole apartment.
Tegan, the reason you have toothpaste all over your back is because you wouldn't get out of the sink.
Tegan, the tape Ali put on the couch is to keep you from clawing it to pieces, not for you to lick the tasty tasty glue off of.
Looks like I'm not one of the lucky winners, but they'll summon me later.
Do I have jury duty? *drumroll*...
@balto I am trying to stop it, that's why I'm debugging it.
omg zombies.
@scrappydoo I'll put it in the thread tomorrow.
@clifford I'm gonna side with @clifford.
@lassie Honestly not sure if I want to do it or not. I could probably get out of it by telling them how spiteful I am of the court system.
Anxious for 4:30 on Thursday, when I find out if I have Jury Duty.
@marmaduke @marmaduke I did feel like a dork for being at a farmer's market, but there was also some spicy salsa that was awesome.
Picked up a block of spicy firehouse monterey jack cheese at the farmer's market today. I have never been this excited for cheese before.
@santoslhalper Kill him.
@hachiko how long were you able to keep it down?
@eddie i'd like a wave invite, if they're not all taken :).
@eddie Advance Wars :D Ali's been playing a lot of Professor Layton, too.
@clifford sounds like you got on one of the better green-line trains.
@rintintin haha, thanks :).
We already beat our 21d6 record with 35d6.
Sham, you need to roll 21d6 for damage on this guy.
Thanks for the nice tweets everyone  :).
@clifford @clifford Ali said yes :) we're engaged!
Happiest night of my life last night :).
Blegh, stayed late at work today. Was on time until we made a catastrophically large database change.
@rintintin That's ok, no one ever trusts the one-armed man. It is always the one-armed man.
@pluto It was a trap!
@toto I didn't even bother to look in the bag. I didn't want to know.
That's... odd. Yum?
@rintintin TIE-DYE IS BACK.
@hachiko omg, you has teh virus.
Terrible  experience today. Didn't get to play, didn't get to DM. At least got to create a mini-adventure. Still feels like a waste.
@dug Oh god, just googled the OP Journal.
Waffle Fries!!!!!
My credit card broke the Soupbox register. My magnetic strip must have a virus embedded in it.
today. My first 3 rolls today: 1, 20, 20.
@lassie If you haven't already setup homebrew on your pre:  :P.
@scoobydoo Ugh, had no idea Imogen Heap was half of Frou Frou. On the plus side, I have 3 new albums to listen to.
@santoslhalper MAN(servant) UP!
@dug I wanted to yell THIS ISN'T BASKIN ROBBINS at her, but then I realized I'm still a sane person and didn't.
Lady in front of me at starbucks has never been here before, she's asking what flavors they have. If she starts asking for sample spoons...
@pluto nerd.
So tempted right now.
@santoslhalper I love this weather. Totally serious.
...and we put up special fences and notices asking people not to commit suicide here. None of it worked.
@scrappydoo Haha, I hope it was the same girl from before. How have things been lately?
@rintintin what did you switch to?
@snoopy @snoopy using trillian astra here.
These are the most excited goats ever.
Hooray! Eberron Campaign Guide came just in time before the weekend!
Amazing weather right now.
@marmaduke I'll be there, but Ali has to work :(.
@hachiko Tux still eats hair. Not because he's cleaning himself, and not always his own.
Javascript map editor's finished with bulk editing and all that good stuff. Finishing up moving characters around the map before I do forums.
@marmaduke hahaha. did you tell her to learn2chicago?
@marmaduke @marmaduke IT'S THE RAPTURE!
@santoslhalper Not really, I miss osaka :(  Just been working a lot lately.
@dug You could go home for lunch. Get your book, make sure guild wars is installed and up to date, etc.
@scrappydoo Been using Trillian Astra after I found out Digsby is using my computer to make them money, until I kill 3 hours configing miranda.
@scrappydoo As long as you have. How long I've worked with an offshore team is another story. The time zone difference is killer.
Starting to get sick of getting reports for bugs that need to be fixed BY the end of the day AT the end of the day.
@hachiko You have to be very focused to crash cars as well as I do.
sad i'm missing out on  this year.
ugh. forgot to have dinner :(.
@lassie Don't worry about logging in, you let me worry about blank.
@eddie are the forums almost done? there must be hundreds, thousands even, waiting to use the broken link on the site!
@dug You better be sorry for trying to give me free money.
@eddie It didn't. I don't know you anymore. You embarrassed me in front of my barista. (Thanks for the email full of links though).
Drinking coffee at 2:30 in the afternoon. Still tired from this weekend.
Finished season 3 of Veronica Mars tonight and caught the 12 minutes of the season 4 pilot. Very sad that it's not still on air.
Blegh, got a flat tire coming back to town last night. Good day to work from home while it's getting fixed at least.
@eddie what is the estimated distance traveled of the card?
@snoopy oh, THAT swillbucks. dibs. but no, they were out of gazebos.
@scoobydoo I hate swilebucks but have a fascination with dollar-associated cards. What else can you tell me about it?
Dreading driving through lollapalooza traffic to get to ohio.
@scrappydoo omg about time. i have a feeling that you're going to like.
@dug Finally tried out 1v100 last night. Wasn't bad. Sad I have to miss Gabe & Tycho as the guests next weekend.
@toto hooray loophole! Are you guys at the wall tonight?
@santoslhalper yeah, me too, but mostly on my pre since I can't get to the site at work.
@eddie mine says I have 30 left, which is mathematically impossible. Maybe mobile listening isn't counted?
@lassie where can I see my used hours on pandora? Is it in your iphone app? I wonder if you iphoners are the big users, I can't find mine.
@clifford Awesome. One of these days I'll work up the patience to try putting OS X on mine again.
@scoobydoo Hah, you joined the netbook party? Which one did you go with?
@eddie amazon.com is the cheapest place I have seen them.
@eddie no, it's not really needed to play, but if you have a class you like, there's usually a book that adds stuff to that class.
@odie Divine Power is one of the newest expansion books for D&D 4e. New stuff for avengers, clerics, paladins, and invokers.
After 2 full days, I finally have a working environment to test this project. I HATE Sharepoint.
omg, Divine Power just came in the mail :D New Avenger build looks pretty sweet.
@pluto epic.
finally got an invite to google voice!
I haven't tweeted in a while...
@odie.
D&D today!
I have yet to see egg in any of my previous requests at FlatTop. Wanting to put a bowl up on the counter with only egg sticks.
Working on a javascript tile-based map editor.
@dug good, haven't managed to get OS X on it, it's nice to have for d&d (pdf book reference), or when I want to surf on the couch.
@odie Sounds like your camera has its charisma score drained.
awesome monday.
note to self: tomorrow's meeting pick a seat that ISN'T between two guys who will be talking to each other the whole time.
@toto Haha, how was it? Edible?
@hachiko Slowly. People keep saying Inactivated.
@eddie I want the rest of the week off. I'm in all day meetings today and tomorrow.
@marmaduke Oh, and also @marmaduke (Blamestorming. We need to have a blamestorming session).
@dug @dug I blame @dug.
@balto @balto are at my previous client now. How awesome was your vacation?
Blocked internet: check. USB cable for unlimited Pre battery: check. System: beat.
totally forgot friday counts as holiday. Hooray surprise day off.
Castle Crashers has the coolest ending to any game ever.
Taking the day off to play Castle Crashers.
hey.
@marmaduke I don't know what either of those things are, but the driver was actually very slow.
omg move.
Still bright, sunny and hot in oak brook, wish some of the rain downtown would move east for no good reason.
@odie nope, i accidentally tweeted it first, and @odie must have refreshed tweetdeck in the 2 seconds before i deleted it.
@santoslhalper hah, that was me telling @santoslhalper about mike hating 4E before trying it.
After trying throwback Mt Dew (& not really caring for it) & now going back to regular (& not really caring for it) i hate it all over again.
@snoopy We have a surplus of chopsticks. Like a whole part of the silverware drawer dedicated to them.
I am a client ping pong ball.
1-Route all US office traffic through Dayton office 2-Tell employees to do online in-browser virtual machine training 3-??? 4-Profit?
Dear guy who was pissed at me on highway 90 for some reason and was really good at holding a grudge: I hope you got home and got over it.
Brunch is awesome. I need to start getting up for this.
I tried WoW gamer fuel mt dew.  Still don't feel like playing WoW.
First really hot summer in Chicago, and I'm out of town. (Peace out suckers :P).
Sushi Campaign was an amazing success.
Hooray, external DVD drive finally got delivered. Now I get to install OS X during our road trip this weekend.
@santoslhalper haha. with the last day in the loop, this is serious business. srsly.
It is a dark world outside. The day star hides itself well. @pluto and I are dedicated though. Sushi will be ours.
@hachiko You should have asked someone on the plane with a  to take that photo. Ya know, so we could see stuff  :P.
@eddie ugh, i finish up my current project tomorrow :( we were planning on going to osaka then if you're downtown.
@marmaduke what was that ringtone site that let you cut up mp3 files into ringtones? i have a phone that doesn't suck now.
It is a lot harder to drink from a motion activated faucet than I ever would have thought.
@scrappydoo Awesome. Publicly available character sheet means they probably wouldn't have an issue with me putting it on the sandbox.
@pluto Did you get the pdf as well? I'd love to take a look if so. At least at the character sheet.
I'm at speedway, directly across the street from speedway. Why, Ind iana, why?
@rintintin Adds glasses? I want bdubs :(.
@odie I haven't used camino, but I think it's just something firefox does.
getting a cold.
Dell mini 9 is here! If only I had an external DVD drive... anyone have one that they're willing to let me use at the office tomorrow?
Man, so much came out of the leaked webOS image today. Here's my favorite:.
@scoobydoo How about a webOS feature to automatically turn on wi-fi if you're at a certain GPS location? :).
Trying twitpic again with my fu manchu cat.
pretty sure twitpic hates me.
wow, the  is only a tiny bit bigger than my last phone (original sanyo katana) like || that much.
Just got the OS update, major improvement on touch responsiveness already.
i didn't use any of the directions, but the GPS on sprint navigation worked pretty well on the drive home.
only gripe so far is how synergy pulls all of my contacts (including AIM screen names). can't specify certain ones, it's all or nothing.
Also, news flash guy who tried to cut in front of 20 people: standing by the register doesn't make you next when you have to take a number.
Hello from my new palm.
I have a flyer. I hope it means i get a phone.
There are about ten people behind me now.
Heard in line: If you're in an accident in a bus, you're going to win.
Everyone else in line has a blackberry or an instinct. My phone is almost embarrasing.
At the sprint store, I have friends already!
Holy crap... I'm glad this woman didn't hit the store I'm going to tomorrow.
@scoobydoo also.
@santoslhalper designers people at my client say that your personal site should only worry about IE 7+, and tell the rest their browser sucks.
You should probably check out all the witty things I tweeted about yesterday for  and add  to them.
I haven't tweeted yet today, and it's.
Practicing faster dice rolling since 5E went real time.
@hachiko no, it's better that way. it might even be a good idea to make it look worse in IE6 :P.
What is the TPK Count box for on the new DM Screen?
Some guy was trimming his fingernails next to me on the train. It was pretty gross.
I'm doing a dev i18n demo tomorrow. I hope no one remembers the demo that was given last year, since it will be the same.
Just had the hottest chicken wrap in my life. Rush hour wrap at The Rail ftw.
In a meeting.
@toto.
Had a migraine. It went away.
@rintintin It is Friday. I require raw fish.
Forgot it was.
ordered a dell mini 9 today, can't wait to throw OS X on it.
@hachiko Yes. In one of the old podcasts, someone mentioned how the DM knows they've won when PCs ask to change their alignment :P.
Just heard the White Stripes version of Tegan & Sara's Walking With a Ghost. It sounded a lot like my heart breaking.
@rintintin i need to suck it up and find a decent netbook to throw os x on  :P.
@balto link to the windows versions plz.
@eddie stop bugging me and read:.
NOT at the Indy 500.
My cats are cleaning themselves. They were dirty. Now they are less dirty and wet.
I liked the intro to the random song that came on my Pandora station. I went to look at who it was. Kelly Clarkson :&lt;.
I wanted to get a steak burrito, but when the lady asked me, I told her chicken. It was good.
Waiting in line at Chipotle.
@eddie I see your keyboard cat and raise you another:.
Was debating whether I should go to starbucks today. I did.
@lassie I'm the jerk who fixed a bug with the RTE so people could put MORE image maps into pages. Aren't I awesome?
@odie it is krod mandoon trying to be serious.
@toto I liked her character, too. What little we saw, at least.
@balto I hear they have salad at salad creations today.
Design stuff didn't turn out bad today. Just need a finished logo and a better color scheme and the site will look pretty good.
Setting myself up for failure by attempting to do some design work.
Finally saw Star Trek. No longer fearful of spoilers.
@eddie Ya, you'll destroy me. It'll be great. I'll play as Dan for comic relief.
Awesome, looks like Castle, Dollhouse, and Better Off Ted all got renewed for second seasons.
@scoobydoo I can't wait to be home, and pantsless.
Lunch was good.
@eddie  is a great excuse to be as boring as possible.
@scrappydoo @scrappydoo But does it have pasta salad?
@lassie Do they have caesar salad?
@lassie What do they have there?
@clifford What's for lunch today? Our list is bland, and we are uncaring.
@odie what conversation? your group has its own. they are waiting for a response from you.
@dug Yeah. It is apparent that our parties have to be forced to work together, rather than trying to actually make a storyline.
@clifford Picked up street fighter IV last night. It's good, but I am not.
@odie ugh, that sucks. you up for a game of something tonight or are you vanguarding?
Brilliant:  Glad Kanye isn't on Twitter to @ me in all caps.
@snoopy Enter Palm Pre Contest.
@toto i'm craving it for a day i will actually be at the office, like thursday.
@odie Hah, The Advantage was the first band that I got into after making a Minibosses Pandora channel.
@scoobydoo Have you heard of The Minibosses? They do a bunch of video game music covers.
@clifford @clifford 's episode will be included, yes?
Support Joss: Save Dollhouse. Fans get their voices heard @pluto  Please ReTweet and join the cause.
@marmaduke Isn't throwback only for a limited time?
@dug even more obvious when developers make _____ designs  :P.
Once he figures out how to retract them, next step: Embedding them into his fists.
@clifford Here's that D&D webcomic I mentioned  (the server is crazy slow on new comic days).
Awesome.  Found the google code repository for the reCAPTCHA ASP.NET library and added in the lang property. Finished with 1 min to spare.
@scoobydoo I never even thought about that.  Is it one-to-one, or are the subtitles actually somewhat eloquent?
@pluto Has to be Pikey.
Are you kidding me? reCAPTCHA's ASP.NET library doesn't let me access the lang attribute to change the language. WTF reCAPTCHA?!
@pluto More Dollhouse!
Wow.  was awesome tonight.  Please don't get canceled!
Sweet, 40% off of one book at Borders for borders rewards members.
Busy morning. Demo went well.  Rewarded with sushi and friends.
@eddie don't encourage her  :P.
@clifford I can't believe I wasn't invited to the decision-making party.
@odie looks like chris doesn't want to go there. 2 against 1.
One of our cats, Tux, drools if you pet him a lot.
@scoobydoo apparently twitter doesn't send your password to you when you sign up. want the one i signed chris up with?  :P.
@dug It's about time you saw the light.
@eddie is using his english degree to write programs to do algebraic equations.
Was wearing an old shirt yesterday that was baggier than I remembered, then i remembered that was a style (sort of).
Because half of the things I think of in a day cause me to remember particular penny arcade strips, I'm going to tweet the strip & the cause.
Listening to techno/trance so I don't start singing randomly today.
Sweet, now we can watch the swine flu zombie outbreak LIVE.
@hachiko Agreed, but @hachiko is also already taken, sadly, by a fictional character.
@hachiko ugh, cspags is already taken.  and they have NEVER updated. this is killing our 'force chris to join twitter' plan.
The chicago fire roll at the sushi house clears my sinuses.
@hachiko so you convinced chris to join twitter, right?
Pandora has tricked me into starting to sing a song at my cubicle twice today.  Damn you! *shakes fist*.
@eddie You made yourself a liar. AGAIN, you double liar.
The place we went for breakfast had  pancakes! Sadly, I wasn't brave enough to try them.
help fix the internet:.
@balto I can't believe you would drink on a school night.
@clifford omg you tweeted more than once, you liar. hope everything goes alright.
One lane highway construction sucks. Hooray google maps.
@odie Your game came today.  I think USPS hates you  :(.
@dug Welcome to Twitter!
@pluto I slappa da bayse!
@rintintin That was only one solution that built, I still have the public solution, which is what really matters, and isn't building now.
@balto Build Succeeded. Pwnt.
@hachiko tell webpass to expand to chicago :P.
Detective work today. Trying to figure out what the people before me were doing with these remote machines.
My train stopped about 50 yards away from my stop because of equipment failure. Ugh.
sweet, my order of the stick board game shipped today  :).
@santoslhalper I have a feeling I will get some nsfw results if I type that into google.
@lassie Pronunciation doesn't matter if you're not speaking :P.
@odie Is it dunkin donuts? that's what I've got at the office.
@eddie mike's texting so i'm tweeting. So this is what this feels like.
We got a roomba today. His name is Broomy.
Blarg, stuck around at the office to fix a bug and now i'm hitting all the traffic on the way home.
The drummer is good, the frontman looks like Austin Powers.
Watching My My My now... Pretty sure this guy's keyboard is on the 'toy piano' setting.
Waiting for people to show up to see the band Arma.
Out of work early on a friday. Woo!
@scrappydoo congrats!
I don't like you, activia yogurt.  Regulating my digestive system should not mean making me not go to the bathroom.
@eddie omg you never tweet anymore.
@dug.
@rintintin are you gonna get the cylon detector app for your iPod touch?
@balto i'm twittering just to show tegan off.
I've got most of the stuff for RPGSandbox ready. Still a few things to streamline, but if I don't start testing now, I never will.
Early Fourth-meal. Hooray.
Going rock climbing at the gym.
One more thing to make a bit more efficient before I'm ready to start live testing RPGSandbox.
Seeing if my new phone plan has kicked in yet.
@hachiko I feel obligated to stop following you now  :P.
@scrappydoo first or second? and did you not finish them?
@pluto you would have to learn ruby (and rails).
@rintintin do you want me to ship you some? fedex overnight? overhour?
Also loved that Sony's implying that Microsoft is taking away constitutional rights by charging for live.
Who would predict a PS3 without a blu-ray drive? The games are ON BLU-RAY DISCS.
Finally found a small lightbox solution that works for me:.
Close to having a usable version of RPGSandbox, hope to deploy sometime next week.
We already have a solution to this!
So the D&D webapp is coming along.  Having some memory issues with one of the pages, need to reduce the database calls.
I ordered a pocket knife from an online craftsman shop. Now I get e-mails about how I can SAVE BIG! on axes.
c'mon, DHL. bring me my 360!
Writing a D&D webapp. 3.5 first, 4E once I get to play.
Wearing my half-life 2 shirt today, lot of comments on it. Kind of funny that everyone recognizes it so easily now.
Hello from my iPod touch :).
Work lunch at cosi.
creating a twitter account.
@marmaduke You're not the first to want it‚Äîtake a look at this:.
@marmaduke Thanks!
@balto Aw, thanks!
...the placebo effect, though a real phenomenon, seems to be quite small.
@pluto Glad it could help!
I envy anyone who can get WebPack to work.
Time zone map.
Yesterday someone said JavaScript is everywhere! to which I responded haters are everywhere.
@snoopy Aw, thanks! Hope they can help.
@snoopy ayyy.
I am debugging the coolest bug I have ever debugged.
@odie PREACH.
@odie YES.
@eddie is No Man's Sky only for PS4 still.
@clifford ‚àóbon jovi voice‚àó you give bots...a bad name.
-I've written Bond now.-Oh. Can you change it or is it too late?-When your coffee's ready they'‚Ä¶.
Shifts in global fame through the ages.
@lassie I don't get upset about it but I like seeing what's changed in translation. Sometimes there are cool nuggets.
I finally did it. I beat Neko Atsume.
@eddie @eddie preach.
Cops are asking  and 23andMe for their customers' DNA.
@dug I don't agree with your position on iPhone encryption. I feel that you should not build back doors into communication systems.
Apple: the Backdoor the FBI Wants Would Work on All iPhones.
Euphoria is a chat system with threads. Imagine chat + Reddit.
@pluto it's even worse than that.
@eddie  has the old apple earphones for like $15 which i buy, wear out after ~1 year, repeat.
@dug goodness, I'm plotzing.
@clifford thank you so much for @clifford I cannot stop laughing.
@lassie I tried to make them stand alone.
@eddie Sure! I'll dig around to see if I can get a discounted copy (usually up to my publisher, not me).
@clifford The book should be all ready to go as is. When the book is finally published, very little of the text will change (if any).
@marmaduke What's wrong?
@dug Soon! There's been a bit of a holdup, but you can get the 99%-finished ebook at.
Cannot wait for the next season of @santoslhalper if it ever happens.
@dug Neko Atsume is the best video game that has ever been created.
@scoobydoo Hope it's a good paradigm shift! Sometimes that happens to me and I feel a sense of doom; so much I've done has been incorrect.
@scrappydoo Glad it could help! Let me know if you run into any issues.
@odie I've had similar struggles with iOS Chrome. Glad to know I'm not the only one!
@scoobydoo Thanks for having me! Feel free to have anyone reach out if they have questions.
@snoopy Looks like 2008 to me.
@rintintin @rintintin @rintintin Thanks for having me!
@santoslhalper how dare they dis Avril.
Just published Expecting.js, an actively-maintained fork of the great Expect.js.
Installing nokogiri with native extensions.
@odie Imba?
That was my second Neko Atsume dream so far.
@lassie This video is amazing.
A town appeared on Google Maps that doesn't actually exist.
The Kick Off 2 World Cup: Competitive e-sports with a 25-year-old Amiga game.
@toto fondly.
DJ + {US military operation name} = @hachiko Follow for golden tweets like DJ Desert Storm or DJ Comfy Bee.
@eddie Yes! Helmet is more for Express than @eddie but it does protect your head.
@scrappydoo Hope my posting on HN didn't cause too much trouble! Had no idea it'd be so popular.
@toto I really liked the Running Costs page on Cushion so I posted it on HN and now you're having to defend your decisions! Sorry.
@dug Not just you.
A post about a JavaScript URL parsing trick I learned at @eddie.
Women: harassment controlT: more characters?W: this guy literally just said he was gonna kill meT: ‚Ä¶.
I had a dream about how rich I am in Neko Atsume.
@balto I can't fav twice.
seems pretty racist.
@odie What happens?
Just played Rivals of Aether for the first time‚Äîsuper fun.
@dug I (1) have never been to the place (2) love the band (3) really enjoy @dug and thank you very much for the show.

@santoslhalper Sure! I'll come down to the lobby? I'm wearing pink.
@snoopy sorry, just saw this! Do you want to meet up before the next talks?
@snoopy sounds good! I'll bug you soon.
A podcast I like just insulted the Baha Men. This injustice cannot stand.
@scoobydoo Would love to chat with you at  (Hope I'm not ruining Helmet.).
@balto.
@hachiko Don‚Äôt abuse Congressional process to ram through CISA. We are watching.
Stop. No. Don't post it. You can resist this time.
@marmaduke TRU.
@santoslhalper ugh.
@rintintin I'm adding TONS of issues, one per bit of functionality I'd like to add. Feel free to grab one!
@toto No problem. Is there a particular part you'd like to get started on?
@clifford I'd love the help! Do you know how to add a ton of GitHub issues at once?

@eddie Angular is client-side browser stuff, where Node and Express are used together to build web servers.
@clifford I feel like Express isn't as widely used as something else like Rails or Django, so probably less.

@santoslhalper I've got 2 Atom invites‚Ä¶still need one?

I love that this is a real Unicode character.
Just published my first @dug package. Ironically, it's VimL syntax highlighting.
@snoopy I like that it's customizable and has dotfiles. That's big for me.
@balto It looks like it'll be open source after the beta.
@scoobydoo Both look very interesting to me. I'm excited for both.
@dug Doesn't it slow JavaScript down a lot?
@pluto Thanks! I'd love to know your feedback.
@marmaduke Not a bad comparison.
@scrappydoo it's invite-only for now.
I think the @marmaduke is just another example of the JavaScript takeover of Earth.
@toto ‚Ä¶can't decide if trolling‚Ä¶.
@clifford I'd be careful about disabling CSP‚Äîit can make you vulnerable to some kinds of attacks.
@toto  on Freenode is hoppin'.
@eddie There was some confusion, but maybe it was just my confusion. It'll be open-sourced after beta.
@eddie It's OSX 10.8+ for now, sadly.
@dug Update: it'll be open-source after beta.
@lassie Looks like  will be open-sourced after beta.
@hachiko It's unclear whether it's going to be open source at this point.

@marmaduke What does the icon look like now?
@snoopy From hanging out on the IRC, it seems like it's not open during beta but will be OSS later.
@rintintin That's what I think.  and other things like it (with things like node-webkit) seem like the future.
GitHub's new @snoopy looks SWEET.
@odie I'd love to play with it if your invites haven't dried up already!
Finished all of the IT Crowd yesterday. Excellent show (except for the pilot).
Just found out about the view command, which is like opening Vim in read-only mode. Occasionally quite useful!
Bummed that @clifford is done with Bowser, their WebRTC-enabled browser for iOS. Hope they'll open-source it.
@balto haha, thank you!
@eddie :).
@lassie I see. Good plan!
@rintintin For what reason?
This might be the funniest Wikipedia page. Thanks @snoopy.
@scrappydoo You're not the only one! I usually have a client and server folder.
I love JSHint, but sometimes you want to disable it completely for a file. Here's how:.

These beats are dope.
Very cool XKCD about frequency.
@eddie The former, although I always find ternary operators more difficult to read than if statements.
@rintintin Node is always touted as more performant than others because it's event-driven. I'd say both are relatively secure.
@marmaduke I've used both, but Express a bit more.
@toto peaches.

@eddie Thanks for sharing my  list!
@santoslhalper I made a list of sites that support two-factor authentication, which might help your hacked friends!
@lassie I started during the first public beta. I didn't use it as my main browser until they added extensions.
@scrappydoo That's how I feel too.
@lassie Technologically and socially interesting. Not sure it's 100% the future, but a very cool idea.
@toto A little, yeah.
Just updated HumanizeDuration.js to version 0.6.0 with German support!

I'll be participating in  in a few days. You should too!
@scoobydoo Glad you liked it!

@santoslhalper I don't know a thing about Marvel but I've heard about this API.
@toto That's the price you pay for (some) security. But I agree that it's too much‚Äîthis is why SPDY seems cool.

@balto I've been unable to reach microjs dot com for awhile now. Is it broken?
Just updated HumanizeDuration.js with Norwegian language support (with some help)!
@rintintin It means more for Node, which will have ECMAScript 6 pretty soon.
Aw, @santoslhalper has no plan to support new JavaScript features like yield.
me.
Can't decide if I should feel embarrassed when I log into GameFAQs.
@dug Thanks! Glad you liked it.
Ann Arbor has gotta stop being so cold.
@pluto Perhaps the fact that Mongo has more users (and therefore more support + community), but that's all I can think of.
There is a religion about filesharing.
The Grand C++ Error Explosion Competition.
@toto I wrote a tutorial about  that MIGHT help with some of your confusion‚Ä¶.
@santoslhalper same for mine, which is why I quit.
@scoobydoo My gut feeling says yes, it's a bad idea but I can't give you a concrete reason why...
This new @balto album is p excellent.
@lassie This tutorial might be of some use:.
Just voted in the .GIFYS.
@hachiko no i dont care idk why.
@eddie that was my wifi. No jokes.
@scoobydoo I use @scoobydoo.
Brilliant: the South Korean government wants you to be able to delete crapware bundled with your phone.
@toto Two-factor authentication is on a number of other websites, too.
Best wifi network names.
@toto I've thought about reading it. You'd recommend it?
About to see a short @clifford talk! Excited.
@santoslhalper Are you?
This Walgreens is not ashamed of its love for Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
@eddie Hope you liked it!
@toto Thanks for sharing!
@marmaduke I think it's DEFINITELY worth it for your email (I can forgot password if I'm in your email), and I use it elsewhere too.
@eddie I registered  at.
@scrappydoo dinner line is endless.
Turning up in the @snoopy.
@balto When y'all figure out transportation details, could you let me know?
My @dug breakfast of champions: popcorn eaten out of a coffee filter.
@lassie where might I find a sleeping area?
Pivot your startup into a criminal organization.
Leaving for @lassie soon!
@pluto will there be showers or will I be filthy this weekend.
There is a World Rock Paper Scissors Society.
Today I learned that there is a maximum weight for jail.
@scrappydoo Thanks for sharing! I love Majora's Mask.
console.loge: such console. so loge. wow.
Google won't break into your home. You'll invite them in.  via @snoopy.
Chrome 32 just broke my getUserMedia. Happening to anyone else?
@pluto Thanks! Super helpful while it's down.
@marmaduke This is the 3rd time it's happened in a few months. Annoying stuff.
npm, please, I beg of you.
@lassie Same for me.
@eddie I've been working on a list of sites supporting two-factor auth. They might help in the cold winter!
Omg same.
@dug @dug Alright. Good to know!
@balto have y'all done NLP stuff with JavaScript? ‚Ä¶and have you done it with Korean?
@toto AAAHH.
Just completely emptied my @scrappydoo reading list. I don't think it's been empty for years.
NSA compared to Stasi. Damn.
@lassie It's to block the other XSS ‚Äî.
@hachiko Express seems quicker to learn but it does much less for you. I think both are good choices, but I'm no expert.
@hachiko I see. It's a price I'm willing to pay, I guess!
@lassie Thanks for sharing my list! Hope it helps some people.
@dug Why? It's certainly less convenient, but it's a lot safer (I feel).
@santoslhalper Agreed! I've made a list of sites that support two-factor authentication, if it helps!
It's so cold in the D.
@pluto Click Clock Wood. No doubt.
@snoopy godspeed, wizard.
@marmaduke Congrats!
@rintintin Using a VERY long password makes it nearly impossible to brute-force.
@scoobydoo hmmmm...I'll keep an eye on this.
@snoopy This looks really cool. Is it web-based?
Improving my blog's security on the heels of @lassie blog hackery.
@dug What have you found? I'd love to learn more about those solutions.
@pluto Mincer is a lot like Sprockets from Rails, but I had more luck with Grunt.
@hachiko It's also worth adding two-factor auth to other sites too. I made a little list, if you'd like!
@toto It'd be tough, I think. It's not the end-all-be-all of security, though.
@eddie Agreed! I made a little list of sites that support two-factor auth if you'd like.
@santoslhalper I made a list of sites with two-factor authentication; perhaps it'll help new year's resolutions!
I just went on Steam and searched video games.
Is there a list of current/upcoming hackathons and programming contests?
NFC: unspeakably cool.
I don't use analytics on my website because I block analytics on the web when I can (thanks @scoobydoo.
@hachiko Great to see that your app is Express-powered, but you might want to app.disable('x-powered-by') to keep hackers out.
Just played Proteus by @marmaduke and @marmaduke A sublime, surreal, and recommendable experience.
@snoopy I'm a web developer who loves your videos. I'd love to help with SRL if I can! Let me know!
Is there a website that shows bitcoin's legality by country?
@balto.
@dug Thanks! I think I'm gonna jump ship with my next laptop.
@snoopy Just read your great article about switching away from Mac. Are you happy with the Dell you bought? How's the trackpad?
@balto I'd love to find a good open-source/not evil alternative‚Ä¶.
Does anyone know what the X-iinfo HTTP header is?
@scrappydoo I see what MIGHT be a security vulnerability on Cryptsy ‚Äî can I DM/email the issue to you?
@odie It's much harder for someone to hack into your account; they'll need your phone's texts to log in. Not immune, but safer.
@hachiko Agreed.
@scrappydoo Unfortunately, it's fairly easy to fake what browser you're on, and very hard to detect this is my phone.
@lassie For how much? I might sell mine.
@balto Thanks! Hope it helps.
@hachiko Can I try it with yours when I get back?
@clifford tags are incredible. Would they work with my phone?
@lassie Talk To Me In Korean is a great site for learning Korean. Maybe worth adding?
@scrappydoo let me know when your post is up!
@toto Personally a big fan of Jade.
Cool that @scoobydoo corporate expense account is, itself, a Venmo account.
@lassie Ah, I agree with that completely!
@dug I think it depends on the site, but I generally agree.
@scoobydoo I think they do!
@hachiko Hope you liked it!
@santoslhalper That happened to me yesterday. It was super annoying.
@clifford really? That sounds dreadful.
@rintintin What happened?
Add this to the list of things to hate about US-based mobile carriers.
Entrepreneurs need to be solving real problems. A great read.
@hachiko I'm making a list of sites that support  which might help your readers.
@hachiko Agreed.
Semester‚Ä¶complete!
@balto Story of my life ;).
@hachiko I'm surprised it's so difficult. Good luck!
@santoslhalper SASS is originally written in Ruby, so I'd imagine its JavaScript port is flaky. Works like a charm in Ruby environments.
@lassie I don't much like Grunt but I use it begrudgingly. I got it working with Jade if you need help.
@rintintin No problem! Hope it helps.
@rintintin If it helps, I wrote a guide called Understanding Express that might explain some things.
@odie Agreed  it's a lot more like Ruby's Sinatra.
@lassie Good luck on your job interview tomorrow!
@scrappydoo Not sure if this helps, but you can put them in your package.json's scripts.
@santoslhalper Glad you like it! Hope it helps.
I still cannot believe Dogecoin is real and that I have a non-zero amount.
Just mistyped my name as Evan Haha.
@balto Stumbled upon a videogame-related API‚Ä¶.
@odie Yup jasmine-node lets one run Jasmine tests from the command line.
@clifford Also:.
@santoslhalper You might be able to do something that gathers the data as it comes in ‚Äî the graph gets more interesting as time goes on. Maybe?
@scrappydoo A few ideas: bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies), tweets-per-minute, GitHub, subreddit data.
@scoobydoo Is QUnit not standalone? I thought it was but I've never used it.
@balto Me too!
@marmaduke Thanks a ton! Anything else you'd like me to write about? Mocha, Passport, and WebRTC are on my list‚Ä¶.
@scrappydoo Thanks for sharing my  site! Hope it helps :).
Only one exam left before the end of my semester!
@marmaduke Turns out that Jasmine has been number 1 for awhile now (for at least two years)! I was surprised too.
@eddie I still love this logo.
@dug Thanks! Welcome to the list.
Thanks to a lot of help, I've added a ton of new sites to my two-factor authentication list!
@odie thanks for sharing! Hope it helps.
@marmaduke Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it helps.
@rintintin Thanks! Let me know if you see any sites I should add.
@pluto Thanks for spreading the word about 2-factor auth. I'm making a list of  services which might help!
@scoobydoo Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it can help some folks.
@toto I'm working on a list of sites that support two-factor auth, which might be useful. Sorry you got hacked!
@dug I've been making a larger list of sites that support two-factor auth. Perhaps you'll find it useful?
@scoobydoo Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps :).
@pluto I'd love to add GoDaddy to my list of sites supporting two-factor authentication.  Any links I can put?
@scrappydoo Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps!
@odie MY SECRET LAIR!
@lassie Thanks for the mention of my two-factor authentication list on Security Now!
@odie The @odie JavaScript Developer Survey shows that people like @odie Mocha, and @odie.
@snoopy I wrote a short guide about understanding Express if you'd like help learning it. Hope it helps!
@odie SuperTest is fantastic. Do you use Mocha with that, or something else?
@scoobydoo This is great!
Current status.
@dug Woah.
@lassie It actually worked -false alarm!
Gonna start a delicious website called SnackOverflow.
It's all fun and games until you have to parse XML.
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo You'd probably ignore things like of and the, and then you could manually exclude things like proper nouns.
@odie @odie What would you want highlighted? What kind of control would you, as a writer, want?
@odie Doesn't seem like it to me, but it's certainly not as big as vanilla JS.
@hachiko @hachiko What do you folks think of the English syntax highlighter?
@clifford Hope it helps!
@santoslhalper Hope my list helps! Thanks for sharing it.
@santoslhalper Thanks for sharing my two-factor authentication list! Hope it helps :).
@scrappydoo Thanks for sharing my link! Hope it helps.
@hachiko Thanks for linking to my list in your Lifehacker article!
@toto That's so cool! Thanks for letting me know.
@hachiko Woah! Cool.
@marmaduke Any chance Venmo wants to support two-factor authentication for better security?
President Obama calls on every American to learn to code. Woah.
It is time for the world's governments to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance.
GitHub and StackOverflow visualized as cities.
@lassie Let me know! I'd love to use it.
@odie Is Bounty for Code dead? I like the idea a lot.
Blog post: the Underhanded C Contest.
@eddie Agreed. I'm building a list of sites that support two-factor authentication ‚Äì would you like to help?
@lassie Are any of the places you've used 2-factor auth NOT on this list? I'm trying to build a compendium.
@santoslhalper You can also enable two-factor authentication in lots of other places, which I'd recommend:.
@rintintin Of course! Any help is welcome.
@dug Made a list of sites that support two-factor auth. Any way I could promote it to help others?
@lassie Thought you might want to add some more sites to @lassie 2-factor auth articles:.
Want a list of every place that you can enable two-factor authentication?
Just donated to @dug for.
Bitcoin's biggest weakness, as I see it, is that it's largely being used in speculation and not real transactions. (Altcoins even more so.).
@scoobydoo I've less than 1 BTC, but yeah. I also think it's very interesting. Interested to see where it goes.
@hachiko are you into bitcoin?
@lassie Very true. I suppose the word seems in my tweet helps.
It seems that we now know the identity of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
Glad we didn't get embarrassed.
@balto Does Hola work by using a proxy, or by some other method?
@hachiko I see. Yeah, I wish there was a way to say this function returns undefined, perhaps with a different -&gt; syntax.
Practicing my Spanish on @dug new Android app. Really slick.
Damn I have a lot of unread messages from ladies.
@snoopy I usually just ignore the return values in CoffeeScript in cases like that -why do you care what it returns?
@snoopy You might be able to do `el.addEventListener 'click', @snoopy but that's the best I can think of.
Just donated a little bit of money to npm!
@eddie There must be a more elegant way to do that, but I admit I can't think of one.
I like the idea of live coding mentioned in this article.
@odie It's settled, then!
Finally started playing with Browserify...it is amazing.
Is there any reason to use Underscore.js instead of Lodash.js?
CoffeeScript is invincible.
@dug Bitcoin would be awesome to have on Newegg!
@odie I don't know of one. Maybe I should hunt for some NLP libraries.
@dug I thought it'd be cool to highlight based on part of speech, but that seems computationally taxing.
@hachiko What are your thoughts on the idea?
@santoslhalper My name is also Evan Hahn and I'm also a developer. Is there a rule that says that we must fight?
@dug Glad you liked it! Hope it helped.
@hachiko Already did!
An experiment: syntax highlighting for English. Scroll a bit to see what it looks like. Would love your thoughts.
Vim completely obliterates fiction.
Anyone have an invite to Lobsters?
@odie.
I do not remember writing this code but I am glad I did.

@balto Found one of your @balto articles plagiarized here. Just FYI!
@rintintin Recently found some of your content copy-pasted on this site. FYI!
My shuffle needs to STEP UP ITS GAME.
Brosing the wob with Gogle Chrom.
@scrappydoo Found your Understanding MVC And MVP copy-pasted on a sketchy website -just FYI!
To me, the most striking thing about the NSA scandal is how it's changed my behavior online. I double-check my private messages.
@lassie I think you might like Oh Land.
@rintintin FYI: found one of your Gigaom articles on a site called OwnTutorials, which has 100% stolen content.
What is this hubbub about Java Script running on the Inter Net.
I can eat 100% of any pizza.
@scrappydoo what.
@scoobydoo who are you.
What organizations are trying to increase internet access around the globe?
Google Apps drops support for IE9. Brave.
@lassie Seems like it -it's been flaky for me today.
@odie Not just you -it's flaky for me too.
I don't know anything about anime, but Youmacon was super cool.
Great answer to what's the hardest bug you've debugged?
The end is nigh.
@clifford I like to think of myself as a hero.
@pluto woah.
All I want is unlimited pizza.
@rintintin I am NOT your friend.
@rintintin Glad it could help!
Was surprised to learn that CSS injection is a real problem.
@lassie unh.
@santoslhalper send me screens.
@santoslhalper good lord.
Second day in a row that there's a milk-carrying man on the bus. This is a different guy and has two gallons. Is this a conspiracy.
@snoopy It's been sorta put on hold -I've been busy with classes. I want to get back to it when I have more time!
@eddie I also love software updates. I updated immediately even though I had things to do.
@santoslhalper Thanks!
@toto It doesn't feel like a big upgrade, I'd say.
I want to know the story behind the guy on the bus wearing the suit, holding a giant poster board and a quart of milk.
@snoopy haha, completely misread that. Sorry! It was a smooth upgrade for me, too.
Downloading OS X Mavericks. Finally I shall surf the web on a surf-themed operating system.
@eddie Do you know what messed it up? I'm downloading it now and don't want that to happen.
Glad @eddie told the @eddie crowd that the Bay Area has great burritos.
Excited to see @clifford give his talk!
Thank you for Sriracha sauce, Huy Fong Foods.
For those who don't know, this is what computers are like.
@dug Right. I didn't quite agree with the article -I think they missed the point.
@rintintin I thought it odd to suggest that some women may not even WANT a seat at the table, rather than some PEOPLE may not want one.
@odie haha, thanks! In what way(s) are we similar?
@pluto Would be interested to know your thoughts on this.
@pluto But do people /dislike/ GitHub?
Are there programmers who don't like GitHub?
Ah, inbox zero.
Happy Ada Lovelace Day!
Pi is a silly constant.
Wow I wish I had more Google+ ads in every part of Google.
@clifford glad it could help! good luck!
My class is being taught by a brony.
@rintintin Any reason to use Disconnect Search with DuckDuckGo? Perhaps to hide my searches from an ISP?
Makin' apps and takin' naps.
@marmaduke pool's closed.
Just added Korean support to Humanize Duration, my little JavaScript library for turning milliseconds into words.
@odie JSHint?
@eddie EJS is probably more accessible to people who already know HTML, but I like Jade.
@snoopy Really good. Like, really good.
Seeing Radiolab live! Very excited.
@rintintin I like Jade. Makes for fewer lines of code.
@hachiko you disgust me.
Just taking normal screenshots while browsing the web.
@lassie I believe the first version isn't written in CoffeeScript, but each subsequent version can be written in the previous version.
How many people are in space right now, dot com.
I completed You Can't JavaScript Under Pressure in 3 minutes, 16 seconds! Can you code quicker?
Blog post about Origin, my entry to @odie.
All Vim everything.
Does Lynx support JavaScript.
@rintintin Glad you enjoyed it! Hope it helps.
A look at the complexity of JavaScript web frameworks shows Ember and Angular on top:.
@marmaduke thanks! Glad they could help.
@odie I left a blue water bottle at the VMWare talk in the Chrysler Building. Any chance you could put it in the lost &amp; found?
I love how they keep saying danger zone in the latest episode of This American Life.
@toto Glad you liked it!
@snoopy You can. It appears in the real browser console, not the Console tab.
Just beat The JavaScript Warrior. A lot of fun!
I Am An Object Of Internet Ridicule, Ask Me Anything by @dug.
The Look In Your Eyes EP by @dug TOO FUNKY.
Excited for @dug this weekend. I intend to build a robot that destroys all humans.
@marmaduke If you need help understanding Express, I wrote a guide that might help!
@scoobydoo I'm going to sleep but girl I got u.
@hachiko I've done a TINY bit. Basically no.
@scoobydoo CoffeeScript and Sugar.js is also that way.
Just updated my Understanding Express.js guide for the latest version of Express. Enjoy!
@scrappydoo Aw, thanks!
The new @dug album is EXCELLENT.
Is there a way I can drive a car with hjkl.
@hachiko I use the latest -1.6.x.
@marmaduke What bothers you about Jade?
@rintintin Thanks! Glad you like it :).
@hachiko I get stuck at the loading screen in three different browsers! :(.
@marmaduke aw girl, thanks for retweeting me.
Play my @pluto submission! It's horrible. You'll love it.
Get a version of the book made out of PURE INFORMATION.
The new @scoobydoo album...it's too good.
@snoopy Definitely. I might ask for your help with synths; I'm clueless.
@toto I'm trying to code up a DAW in my spare time and it's both fun and confusing. Would love your feedback sometime.
@dug Thanks for the follow! Do you do music...stuff?
Shag carpet may have gone out of style, but rubbing your feet on them never will.
illuminati pizza followed you.
Does anyone on Twitter know what websites are.
@scrappydoo Yes to both, I believe.
Every now and again, I have to go into a DOS command prompt, and it is a struggle.
Does CoffeeScript Have a Future?
Got really hype today explaining HTTP.
I have the power to tweet nearly 145 characters.
@balto girl please that's an adjective.
School is a prison ‚Äî and damaging our kids seems a bit hard to believe in parts,  but a good read.
@snoopy I like @snoopy and @snoopy and sometimes @snoopy .
@balto.
@pluto do you want hella electro funk.
First day of the semester!
@toto woah.
Anyone have experience with HTML canvas-based UIs?
@scoobydoo I see. I like that there are fewer lines of code and that it makes scoping easier, but I understand not liking CoffeeScript.
@balto Why does this matter to people? I'm genuinely curious; don't think me accusatory.
New Zealand bans software patents.
@marmaduke @marmaduke Absolutely -the setup is trickier, and sometimes not worth it.
@dug Thanks for your App Settings on Express.js Middleware -super helpful!
@santoslhalper I prefer it because it enables me to write the same code in less time with fewer bugs. But it's a matter of preference.
@eddie my dad does that too.
@hachiko I'd check @hachiko .
@hachiko Do what makes you most productive.
Is there a web application security newsletter of some kind?
NSA officers spy on love interests, which they call LOVEINT. I like that name a lot.
Can't believe I saw the Ballmer news on my weird Twitter list.
@clifford ECMAScript 6 will hopefully solve this, and I think Browserify is a good solution too. But sometimes you just need to load stuff.
@scoobydoo that actually sounds like the worst.
@eddie Noticed a typo in the FAQ: Every segment of a marketplace has it's different factors should be its different factors.
@snoopy In response to your comments here:  He wasn't observing Ramadan &amp; had a real ID. He's not to blame.
I'm at a loss for words -@toto was detained by the TSA for over four hours. Chilling stuff.
@lassie Promises look a bit ugly in CoffeeScript. Setup is much harder (source maps, auto compilation, etc). I think it's worth it.
@eddie Alright -thanks!
@scoobydoo That's what happens -I'm on a plane and they inject that script at the top of every page, which I'd love to block.
Playing around with mining Feathercoin (a Bitcoin-like currency). It's confusing stuff!
@snoopy Would love to add this to the list of blockables:.
@marmaduke There's controversy around the topic, but I love CoffeeScript. Lets me write the same code in less time with fewer bugs.
@dug I see. Does your current JavaScript solution work?
@santoslhalper Why not just use .extends?
@santoslhalper Try this:.
@lassie What are you trying to do? What does the JS look like?
My phone wisely autocorrects Unicode to Unicorn.
Groklaw shuts down because of government spying.
I always love it when people write hyperlink.
@snoopy Elephant Man would've also been a good call.
@dug Glad you liked it! Hope it helped.
@marmaduke no.
Not sure why Pitbull named himself after what is by far the ugliest dog.
Just posted my first Bower package!
@dug 'c' does.
Great (and funny) description of how hard it'd be to crack AES-256.
O.K., Glass.
@balto infinite breadsticks.
Needless to say, my family could NOT guess my brother's 20 Questions choice of oil derrick.
@rintintin It's regional.
@marmaduke where are you off to now?
Going through a pretty serious pita chip withdrawal right now.
@pluto fifty k.
Just searched burrito on Shutterstock dot com.
@dug I must say that I think ternary operators are harder to read.
@dug I think that's because the ? checks if something is undefined or null, not truthy.
@hachiko I think it depends on whether you're building a large-scale app that'd benefit from type checking.
@lassie Glad you liked it!
Fixing bugs and giving hugs.
@scrappydoo what the hell.
My first Android app.
@lassie BitBucket, maybe?
@snoopy GitHub is down, it looks like.

@scrappydoo DreamHost is fantastic for WordPress.  (Full disclosure: that's a referral link.).
@marmaduke If I'm writing from scratch, Stylus. If I'm using third-party stuff, LESS. It doesn't matter much, though.
SwiftKey got me turnt up.
Funniest video in earth history.
@balto MM is more artistic, OO is a more accessible game.
@santoslhalper i would pay infinite dollars.
@dug don't die.
@pluto like.
@toto same.
@balto I want to make video games that look like that.
@rintintin Glad to see another Sriracha enthusiast out there.
Got that surgical precision in Mario Kart.
They did it. They made their website responsive.
@lassie DID YOU SEE THAT GUY WHO SUBMITTED THREE LANGUAGES IN ONE FILE.
@balto CoffeeScript is more mature and aims to improve JavaScript's syntax, where TypeScript adds features for compile-time checking.
@eddie Glad you like them!
My life improved after I stopped caring about spaces versus tabs.
@scoobydoo Glad you like it!
@toto woah damn your Scales thing is sick.
the new @pluto album, which is excellent.
Guys. I'm pretty sure I found the coolest cake ever created.
@eddie.
This is a great talk about becoming a real programmer. (Don't be fooled -it's not about JavaScript.).
All I want is for @santoslhalper to release ‚ñ≤PERFECT STRIDE‚ñ≤ I have no other desires.
@hachiko Looks like you've been hacked.
@balto damn how ya doin is dope.
@lassie what is this mob.
Time to have the perfect evening with Bobby Vinton.

@scoobydoo I'm all about that git grep.
@pluto I've listened to that God Only Knows thing a bajillion times. It's real good.
Google doesn't want @marmaduke users to run servers? What the hell?
smh if you aren't using Vundle to manage your Vim plugins.
Backbone.js Deconstructed is a long read and is very well-done.
@balto I'm gonna die.
@odie the Burial at Sea looks REAL.
@odie oh DAMN.
@snoopy WHERE.
Current status: eating string cheese like it's my job.
Every time zsh corrects a typo, an angel gets its wings.
I wish that you could sync the settings you've set in Chrome extensions.
Bootstrap 3 goes flat, mobile-first, and renames hero-unit to jumbotron, finally.
@lassie I'd add some simple CSS to the web app to improve consistency with your mobile apps. One-line change.
@scoobydoo dislike.
Made a little music with Famitracker yesterday. It's confusing (to me) but very fun.
Fergie is real programming music.
Got my Vim lookin fly as hell.
Wow, Opera is just Chromium now.
@scoobydoo How can I help, as a US citizen?
@marmaduke I looked up random facts before writing that; I had no idea either!
@hachiko I thought it goes afterward in that case. I suppose I'm not sure.
@scoobydoo What else is there?
@lassie @lassie Welcome to SoundCloud. It's real.
@pluto move the comma in (insert Xbox One-80 pun here,).
@rintintin It wasn't much work to make my blog work in IE8, but I use PIE and some polyfills for IE8.
@clifford Glad you liked that line. It was probably my favorite to write.
Despicable stuff. US government wants private SSL keys.
Pretty sure I'm never going to meet anyone amped about how great DRM is.
Just called in to.
@lassie I'm one of your constituents. Please support the Amash amendment to curtail unconstitutional NSA surveillance.
I think Google's Chromecast is a pretty big deal.
@pluto I'm a big fan of BitBucket for private repos. It's like 90% of GitHub but unlimited private stuff.
@dug You just open sourced BuddyMeme and I looked at your commit log and it's horrible.
@lassie LIKE.
@balto maybe that's a sign that you shouldn't get into Bluetooth.
@scoobydoo damn.
@dug thug lyfe.
@rintintin i'm gonna be constantly doing acid until perfect stride comes out.
@rintintin I just got it on Steam for Mac -hit me up if you wanna play (and if it's even possible).
My jaw drops at this monolithic, 3432-line vimrc that is large enough to destroy Tokyo.
I wonder how many people who said the pen is mightier than the sword were killed with swords.
@scrappydoo On what system are you playing Borderlands 2?
@odie I mean‚Ä¶that's a thing that happens. It happens to me all the time.
@lassie.
@dug.
What if you could see wifi?
@dug Not a bad idea at all.
I've been playing around with L√ñVE, the Lua game engine. It kept me up past my bedtime.
@odie Furreal? It's my favorite as well.
@rintintin a weird idea.
2015: every website is made with Bootstrap.
@balto I really liked Code School's Objective-C class (free).
@clifford announces integration with fetchmail.
smh if you aren't using Sugar.js.
I really don't like the programming term duck punching.
@hachiko truer words have never been tweeted.
My Promise, the new Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song!
@hachiko How does sleuth.vim adjust your tab settings? Does it look at the file and detect things? Does it go by file extension?
@odie how would you define the word suppy.
@snoopy Thank you for this link and I am now coffing.
@rintintin Are you using any Backbone plugins?
@clifford What don't you like about it?
@clifford Yes.
@odie.
@scrappydoo What keeps Skype from being threatened by a company that uses WebRTC?
Woah woah woah what is Java Script.
@pluto I'll add SOMETHING. Time will tell.
Switched to a new branch 'quiz_khalifa' (thanks @marmaduke.
@dug Not sure, I'm not big into analytics.
@balto are you gonna get a Chrome Book.
I feel like the Vim/Emacs debate has probably claimed lives.
The worst part about Vim is that you can't give it a hug.
Unchecked NSA spying undermines freedom. We need transparency and accountability now.
@snoopy I'm gonna sound like an asshole when I say Google Chrome but it's good.
@clifford I heard that -that's so surprising.
@marmaduke DO NOT go on that guy's website. It's straight a virus.
Switched to a new branch 'pingpong_helmet' (thanks @pluto.
Statistically speaking, is flying the safest method of travel? Better than driving, certainly, but safer than walking? Biking?
Three years later, FaceTime is still a crappy name.
zsh makes me smile.
@toto And now I feel like an idiot.
@scoobydoo Glad it could help!
I stand with Snowden.
@pluto That's a little over 4 views a person.
Why mobile web apps are slow by @balto is a fantastic read.
@hachiko suppy.
@rintintin Glad you liked it!
@odie It's been a month. Tell me what you think of the PS3 controller.
@dug I feel like Bluetooth is an underrated technology.
YOLO Ono.
If I ever go to space I'm bringing a Gameboy Advance.
24-bit colors in Vim, I hear? Things are about to get real.
I wanted to search how to implement a calendar program but I instead searched h and that was substantially less helpful.
Aw, no more daily @toto emails.
Mimosa is what I've always wanted.
Woah. Roole looks like the new best CSS preprocessor.
@dug damn.
Switched to a new branch 'hair_object' (thanks @balto.
@balto I quiver.
What programming languages/techniques do you think of as dark arts?
@odie ‚Ä¶pizza.
America's worst charities is horrifying.
A lot of people miss Google Reader, but will anyone miss Google Latitude?
Oh, zsh.
Aliasing g to git is one of the best things I've done.
@dug I've been thinking about learning COBOL just so I can always have a job somewhere.
I'm always impressed at the code that powers @eddie Works very well.
@scoobydoo i'm listening to bandz a make her dance.
@eddie best remix of it:.
Probably my favorite GitHub project.
@lassie Hmm‚Ä¶my link works for me but yours doesn't.
Fun fact: the NSA is a figment of your imagination.
Fun fact: if you're employed by the NSA, laws do not apply to you.
@santoslhalper I'm no thief, the internet is anarchy.
Are coders worth it?
3:47pm: discovered that my shirt was on backwards.
@lassie Tell me what you think!
I donated to @snoopy because the internet is serious business.
@pluto Just told my boss about @pluto.
@eddie I think Duck Sauce's It's You album art got screwed up, FYI.
@scrappydoo Did you choose that URL?
What if we changed the name of the United States to Murica.
What are people using dotjs for?
@clifford pretty specific choice of ancient year.
@toto Just updated my Twitter bio. You might like it. Maybe.
TypeScript's difference from JavaScript is that it‚Äôll just have more type annotations.
If they made Heelys in men's size 11 (US), I'd buy them.
There are a lot of things America does that I don't like, but I still somehow like this weird country. Happy 4th of July.
Who cares that Bart Simpson is on strike, he's not even real.
Saw this gem at the airport.
Is there a dictionary on Android that's like the highlight-define on iOS?
I am about to embark on 26-hour transit adventure.
Perfect Stride by @toto looks TOO SWEET.
Why do all task managers suck?
@balto I definitely prefer CoffeeScript.
Nature is far more imaginative than we are.
The speakers on the HTC One are LOUD, gat damn.
@santoslhalper Glad you think so!
@toto Thanks for sharing my article!
@marmaduke my body is ready.
@clifford I don't like to think.
@clifford tell me about your experience with it.
@pluto What is this Twitter MMO you've been playing.
@eddie Neither.
@scoobydoo Glad you liked it!
@odie for what reason?
@marmaduke no.
@hachiko I'm glad you liked them.
@pluto How can I help you with @pluto.
@scrappydoo Did you ever have a good android one?
Let's go on a Kanye Quest.
@eddie Let me know if you love those.
@scoobydoo Oh snap.
@eddie I've really liked Falcon Pro.
@lassie Recently got an HTC One and I love it.
@marmaduke I really like Falcon Pro. It's not quite Tweetbot but it's good.
I recently got an Android phone (HTC One). Anyone have any recommendations?
@marmaduke good read. Thank you.
@toto Even if I'm not tracking sleep?
@dug I don't get SleepBot's alarms. Do they always go off?
@lassie Would love to hear your impressions.
NSA spying flap extends to contents of U.S. phone calls.
@clifford was it a review having played the game?
@toto I didn't actually read the review, but I believe everything you say unconditionally.
@scrappydoo fyi.
Pretty proud of my branch names.
Many of my heroes are proud neckbeards.
@clifford Yes -This American Life really showed me the issue.
@toto.
@balto What can I personally do to help stop patent trolls?
@scoobydoo Let me know if you find one.
@hachiko Glad you liked it!
Google retiring Chrome Frame.
Liking Android so far.
@hachiko thanks.
@hachiko Can you recommend a Reddit app for Android?
First tweet from my new phone!
@eddie pls don't die.
Ooh, look at my sexy Chrome devtools.
@eddie No. I don't think I even knew of OpenStack before this moment, sadly. I can help you with Linux-specific stuff.
@santoslhalper I can help you because I Linux.
@scrappydoo Why in the world.
@marmaduke I'm just getting it because I wanted one and because iOS 7 terrifies me. I will take your advice.
The Wack Album.
@dug I am getting an HTC One. Have you any recommendations for me as an Android newbie?
@toto Wow. Loads better.
@balto ON MY WAY.
@clifford I saw Sedaris read some passages from Let's Explore Diabetes and it was hilarious.
@pluto double‚Ä¶decker‚Ä¶pizza‚Ä¶I need a moment to re-evaluate everything I ever knew.
@dug Was it vega-pizza?
Pizza.
Sad code.
@snoopy I am stupid. Yeah, it's at 6pm.
@lassie Yeah. I'm excited for their announcement tomorrow.
@clifford Yeah. I'm not a huge Halo fan; I'm a Bungie fan.
@toto halo.
Microsoft: ‚ÄúWe have games in 60 FPS!‚Äô.
@balto That is a great and horrible name.
@clifford One of them just won a bet.
@lassie lightning crashes behind him as he summons the Dock.
Summon the Dock.
@lassie I know. Kind of‚Ä¶weird, for lack of a better adjective.
Apple can get huge cheers for fixing their stupid fullscreen bug.
@toto you complete me.
@hachiko I'm watching Twitter; saw the new 360.
@scoobydoo Not yet.
@scoobydoo Your girl @scoobydoo is on Twitter now.
All I want is WebRTC on iOS.
@balto It's like Nerd Christmas.
Twitter is the best liveblog.
Sign the petition to pardon the NSA whistleblower. Pessimistic about the effectiveness of this, but it's easy.
@pluto Tell me how it is!
Damnit, US government.
@rintintin Glad you liked it! Thanks for sharing.
@odie Glad that you liked it!
@toto Glad they could help!
@marmaduke I have!
@scoobydoo I don't think it's MUCH better than bash inherently, but the community is much better.
@marmaduke You are a hero. zsh is too legit to quit.
@lassie Thanks for writing about my Express.js tutorial on your blog! Honored that you shared it.
@scoobydoo Thanks! Glad you liked it.
@snoopy Honored that you thought it was fantastic!
@scoobydoo Haha, glad you liked the quote. Hope the tutorial was helpful!
@pluto Haha, glad you liked the quote!
@rintintin Glad you liked it!
@toto Thanks for the ZSH configuration post -super helpful!
My Express.js tutorial made it into JavaScript Weekly! There must be some mistake.
What can I do to stop this stuff from happening?
@marmaduke 1 GB = 1 MB. they're equivalent.
@pluto That's either ballsy or those are fake passwords.
@dug suppy.
@eddie &lt;3.
Alright, zsh. You will be mine.
@scoobydoo Are your dotfiles (or your zshrc at least) on the internet?
@eddie I'm all about that customization. It's time to zsh.
@scoobydoo Tell me everything you know about zsh.
@santoslhalper Tell me about Fish. I'm thinking about ditching Bash for either Fish or zsh.
@snoopy I suppose. I'm sure they wouldn't mind much.
@eddie @eddie guys what's with all the lasers coming out of your eyes and mouths.
@scrappydoo It's a good thing their music is excellent.
@santoslhalper Same with Dave Brubeck.
@scoobydoo I liked  Kim Pine.
@eddie So glad it could help! That's why I wrote it :).
@odie Glad you liked it!
COBOL on Rails.
@scrappydoo Glad I could help!
@lassie LIKE.
@clifford.
git push origin bazinga.
@santoslhalper Ah, okay. I figured it was symlinking and not some special preference.
@odie Tell me more.
@dug Suggestion: EpoxyJS.
@odie woah.
Hit terminal velocity on the Heelys.
Guys what if P decided to be equal to NP.
@odie Is k.
A method of timekeeping on Mars.
@marmaduke is the LSAT on a Friday or Saturday?
@eddie I thank you for improving my morning measurable amounts.
@pluto Your logo looks EXACTLY like the Open Source Initiative's. FYI.
@pluto I am actually getting nostalgic tingles.
@balto ‚Ä¶mother of god.
@scrappydoo WHERE? I LOVE Banjo-Kazooie.
Love what @marmaduke is doing.
@balto that's me.
@odie Thanks!
@pluto It's not working for me either...
@snoopy ignore that last b.
@toto I'll take a look. Sails looks cool too, by the way b.
I just published a long guide about Express, the Node web framework. Enjoy!
@balto I'm on hookcity if you wanna join me.
@hachiko k.
@balto I'm writing a programming tutorial and it's FULL of references to anime. fyi.
@odie Indeed. I think I'd prefer a few more lines for a bit more readability!
Woah. Sinatra refactored into 6 lines of code.
Lana Del Taco.
What app are you using to get the branch names? he asks as he merges the branch named hit_90_on_the_segway.
mySQL, I beg of you, please.
@scoobydoo damn.
@hachiko anime.
I have three things on my desktop. (1) a folder called anime (2) pizza.gif (3) Evan Hahn learns the COBOL programming language.txt.
Wrath of Khan Academy.
@eddie that's actually just for show.
@scrappydoo and my adorable pop-country lifestyle.
@toto I'm tswizzle.
@lassie your hyphens could use some work.
@toto I'm actually offended.
I'm writing a blog post and my favorite phrase so far is you will see a dark world of HTML crime.
I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag.
East should be the new North, says this article.
I am learning a little bit of Objective-C and I am amazed that anyone can get anything done.
@scoobydoo I prefer that approach too, but frameworks can let you iterate much more quickly if you're well-versed.
@toto rap game coffeescript.
@eddie May it happen this summer as well.
@hachiko @hachiko Now I'm curious.
I am going to listen to this playlist.
I feel good when I see Merge pull request  from EvanHahn/twilight_rugrats_slashfic in the commit history.
My pull request from a branch called pizza_kickflip was not approved.
My Unicode prayers have been answered.
@scoobydoo You know it.
Happy that my website looks okay in Lynx.
@scoobydoo ugh.
@rintintin haha, will do!
@eddie I assume I can't use my student micro plan for whatever I want -they have to be school projects, right?
I sincerely hope I can't OD on fruit juice.
Didn't know about ZZ in Vim. A shorter :wq.
@scrappydoo If you are like me, it will soon consume you.
@dug I agree. I like so close to cool.
@lassie I think Microsoft is close. A company of their scale could become cool again in one year.
@toto I think a visionary CEO would do them well.
@rintintin DAMNIT. I want them to win.
@hachiko Did Microsoft's?
@snoopy Dat abstraction indeed.
@santoslhalper Basically, they compile to CSS to make it nicer. Just like CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript to make it nicer.
@marmaduke As you get more into CSS, start using a preprocessor. SASS and and LESS are popular, though my favorite is Stylus.
@odie My blood is pure JavaScript/CoffeeScript so let me know if you need help.
@clifford I don't think you can CoffeeScript without JS knowledge, but CoffeeScript is lovely.
Compass, please.
@scoobydoo will check out.
I just read the word Java and thought of coffee, not the programming language. Is this what being normal is like.
@marmaduke That was another time.
@scrappydoo Mandarin.
Sup haters I'm getting cool.
‚ÄúWe already have what practically amounts to a bytecode VM in our browsers‚Äù.
@eddie I'll take a look!
@snoopy My logo looks perfect on this nerdy JavaScript website.
Just published my first package to npm! Scary and weird.
@marmaduke Looks like it's down for some:.
@clifford Yeah, it looks like it's down at the moment.
@scoobydoo Have you a preference between TypeScript and CoffeeScript?
@toto I'm a fan of it. They don't fix JavaScript's syntax like @toto does, but they supplement it with a bunch of nice features.
@marmaduke Yeah. I don't think it's QUITE as good as GitHub, but I have to be looking for the weaknesses to find them.
@marmaduke Yeah. I use them for private repos because you get unlimited, but I think GitHub has the edge.
Bitbucket is slowly catching up with GitHub.
I had a dream where I became a pizza and it was cool.
Evan Hahn versus the snooze button.
@rintintin that's me.
@pluto Here are my minor comments:.
@pluto @pluto I don't know about that, but I'm happy to take a look.
I don't trust ternary operators. They're shifty.
@dug hit me up if you have questions.
@odie Because I don't like the tracking, I use @odie and block all ads pretty much unconditionally.
.@toto is just so cool.
@pluto Small bug (?) report: there are 2 albums called Sam Sparro by an artist of the same name. 1 is just previews, 1 real songs.
Birds aren't descended from dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs. ‚Ä¶ This is a good world.
@marmaduke K.
@marmaduke I'm tempted to do a series called Evan Hahn Learns Weird Programming Languages. Your thoughts?
@dug I'm tempted to learn it.
This is the weirdest programming language I've ever seen.
@scoobydoo love their homophobia.
Concept: making asynchronous JavaScript loading look synchronous.
There are just not enough flashlight apps out there.
@eddie Done!
@odie DAMNIT, I love this logo.
@snoopy I would love an npm sticker or t-shirt if DevSwag would like to make them!
@scoobydoo.
I just wrote some code that will break in about eight thousand years.
Que Onda Quero Beck.
Every time I use Z, I'm amazed and very happy.
@scoobydoo I AM SO JEALOUS.
@pluto I love it.
Just made my first commit to some @scrappydoo code!
PHP, please, I beg of you.
Does anyone out there prefer Mercurial to Git these days? Git seems to have one handily.
Don't know why I was so afraid of learning @santoslhalper It's easy and I feel late to the party.
@scoobydoo IMO, didn't like it. I heard the second was much better.
@dug ugh.
If you'd like, use code DRM2013 today for 50% off on my @lassie book!
Just played a few hours of Halo 1 for the PC. Oh, how I missed this game.
My favorite part: here are fish.
And so my summer begins.
@dug LIKE.
@snoopy I am honoured to have provided you with your summer's soundtrack.
@hachiko That'd be sweet!
I was going to write another semester, another dollar, but my tuition is about 40,000 bajillion times that.
There is one swivel chair in this exam room and I am sitting in it. I suspect it will double my grade.
@scoobydoo Is there a way to post an RSS feed with a link to 8tracks?
@hachiko peep this beat.
@scoobydoo Agreed.
@balto Would love a Noon Pacific RSS feed.
@pluto I find that merges are always a pain but the alternative is do all your work on master.
Just passed 1000 points on @pluto My avatar is now an exquisite monkey.
Feeling kind of somber trying to work hashtag yolo, hashtag swag into my future epitaph.
smh if you're not listening to funk.
@marmaduke Have you any experience with CDNjs?
@dug Wouldn't call myself smart, but this seems like it'd be slow, especially on mobile connections.
@hachiko Thanks for your HTML select/option list for US states! (This:.
@lassie You could also post some ideas to the Internet Wishlist.
If you love C++, I'd love to hear why.
I'm not a big fan of C++, but C++11 makes things a lot less infuriating.
@snoopy will do.
@santoslhalper I'm lucky -I'm flying home on Wednesday. I won't rub it in.
@balto he also had some issues with his monkey iirc.
@clifford I want to go to there.
@balto I know, but I can't believe I'll probably live to see fusion power happen.
FaceTime is a horrible name.
I had no idea we were on the way to fusion power. This is big stuff.
@santoslhalper.
@toto Twuffer.
phuby wraps PHP in a loving embrace.
@toto I figured as much.
@marmaduke YEEEEEE.
@scoobydoo ?
1981 $300,0001987 $50,0001990 $10,0001994 $1,0001997 $1002000 $102004‚Ä¶.
Just got my first popup in years, from @eddie no less.
@balto i don't like my stuff anymore i just kick it from my head, you know what i'm sayin, i can do that.
fergalicious no dictionary results.
@scoobydoo impossibru.
@hachiko Voting would be awesome. I'm a coder and I'd love to help for a few hours if I can!
@scrappydoo yet.
This is what we call bullshit pseudoscience.
This might be the coolest programming news story I have read.
I think the Internet Wishlist (@toto has untapped potential.
I just had to stop reading Twitter because I was laughing so hard.
I don't know if I could ever fall in love with Objective-C.
Hit me up on the Internet Relay Chat.
Just backed my first @eddie project!
Just watched Minecraft: The Story of Mojang. Would recommend!
@lassie I'd love an Add to Rdio feature.
@clifford Any plans to add CoffeeScript support?
smh if you don't prefer CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
Just watched my first episode of a Korean drama. I could get into it.
Do yourself a favor and listen to @rintintin.
@pluto It's 2013.
@pluto I have to use it for work and it's confusing as hell.
Sugar.js is a pleasure to use. Imagine a world where JavaScript had a great standard library.
I'm glad funk is back in the mainstream. Thanks, Daft Punk.
I'm switching operating systems.
My roommate just caught me bobbing my head REAL hard at the Super Nintendo Zelda soundtrack.
@marmaduke I was just asking for an Android-using friend of mine.
@scoobydoo also, listen to the Daft Punk single.
@marmaduke i &lt;3 kreayshawn.
@scrappydoo What's the sleep app you use?
@lassie Gucci Gucci Loui Loui Fendi Fendi Prada.
@scoobydoo How can I get involved and help? Pardon my ignorance.
That guy was probably not wise to be texting on a motorcycle.
Dat Ann Arbor weather today.
@snoopy that's hilarious Hahn.
Quitting Google Reader has actually been great.
Wait...Chat Heads are actually SWEET. I want that API for everything, not just Facebook.
It is time to move on from Backbone.js -I agree. A comparison of front-end JavaScript frameworks.
@eddie Thank @eddie for the logo.
@rintintin it's a DELIGHT.
English Teacher Needs Your Help -And Your Blood!
@balto I swear by Tweetbot.
Locked myself out, but I ate some delicious pizza earlier.
@clifford Have you any places in mind?
@hachiko Do it!
Just voted for @dug for the best UX in the Webby Awards.
Current status: pizza.
@hachiko I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan and I oppose CISPA. FYI.
OH THANKS FOR THE BUS ERROR, C++, YOU'RE JUST A DELIGHT TO PROGRAM IN.
Ooh, electronic mail.
@pluto Agreed.
@pluto I LOVE CoffeeScript, and I'm not the only one. GitHub and Dropbox are two major companies that use it.
@marmaduke In CoffeeScript, I think that nomenclature exists to contrast between =&gt; and -&gt;.
@snoopy I believe it's considered bad practice to have compiled files under version control.
@odie.
Am I a man of mystery if I just like mysteries.
@eddie It doesn't? I had luck with it on my Mac.
@eddie Yeah, it's silly. At least there's a plugin for it.
@snoopy In what way?
@hachiko Yeah, it's what I use.
@pluto Maybe once every two weeks? It just seems like I'm at the mercy of software, which isn't how it should be.
@toto Perhaps I need to learn iOS development to help my 10 gazillion friends.
@odie I archive a lot of stuff, but I'd rather not have to search everywhere to find an old note.
@marmaduke My main problem with iOS text editors is that they don't handle thousands of notes well. Have you any recommendations?
@scoobydoo Y'all should add yourselves to this page.
@balto Really? I'm intrigued.
Computer program that learns to play classic NES games is the coolest thing I have ever seen.
@eddie so is homophobia.
@balto Agreed. I wish Daytum were still developed.
@hachiko Microsoft Office 2003 and N64 games.
@rintintin WHEN.
@scrappydoo hey can you arrange another playdate for me and Joe.
@scoobydoo.
@marmaduke Yeah, I can't really complain!
Every time I use Windows 8, I'm amazed at how much I don't understand Windows 8.
Archer!
Illiterate except for emoji.
Still deciding what to do with my Raspberry Pi.
@scrappydoo Not really. I bought .5 BTC when it was around $75 and sold when it was about $135.
The real question: will Chrome's new Blink engine support &lt;blink&gt;?
Great presentation on CoffeeScript versus TypeScript.
@rintintin I'll let you know when I get it and then when I love it.
Bitcoin is going down a lot -glad I sold when I did.
@santoslhalper You should try Minecraft. It's not quite as volatile as bitcoin but is much more fun.
@clifford You've convinced me.
@pluto You might like The Little Book on CoffeeScript.
@marmaduke Thanks!
@eddie What environment are you on? I'm looking for a good TypeScript editor.
@marmaduke Are you using TypeScript on a non-Windows machine? What development tools do you use?
@scrappydoo rap game i love my logo.
Current status.
@balto Haha, glad you liked it.
@dug The is it snowing? example on the goodies page doesn't seem to work. FYI.
@marmaduke Agreed.
This is a fantastic idea: They Should Paint The Bay Bridge Gold.
@dug No opinion.
What if I made a text adventure MMO.
People will still say hashtag swag in the year 2522.
Geneva Convention over configuration.
I like how I use a text editor that's older than I am.
@clifford I'll check them out -thank you!
@lassie Anything you'd recommend? Pardon my ignorance.
@clifford It'll go down eventually. It's interesting to watch, though.
@marmaduke About $50. I bought 0.5 BTC.
@scrappydoo Do you use any plugins?
I've made $8 by investing in Bitcoin. This is getting interesting.
@toto.
Sometimes I want to scream I hate C++ but I'm never in a thunderstorm.
Part of me misses when the whole internet looked like this.
@hachiko I will read every word.
@odie It's FANTABULOUS.
@santoslhalper Hit me up on internet chat and I'll tell you.
@balto Take my hand, I will show you the way.
Just beat Bioshock Infinite. Spoilers: WHAT.
@odie dislike.
@balto it's true.
@scoobydoo next time perhaps.
Wow, PHP is bad.
All magic comes with a price.
My roommate and I are getting good at making bulgogi.
@dug Jealous.
Is it pathetic that I programmed my computer to wish me happy birthday.
I'd rather be in Boston.
Using Windows for the first time in many years. This is uncharted territory.
@clifford I tried to make it short -I hope you like it!
You can now buy the digital copy of my book on @pluto Do you have any idea how horrifying this is?
@scoobydoo Love what you guys are doing -making me proud to be from the Bay Area!
@odie Thanks! It's my first book, so let me know if you have any questions!
@hachiko Looks like the ebook of my book is out!
I had a dream that I tried to surf around Michigan.
You just received 0.000008 BTC (worth $0 USD) from an external bitcoin account.
@dug For non-rap stuff too?
@scoobydoo Agreed.
What's the best lyrics site? I feel like most of them are horrible.
To confuse it's and its is to commit a cruel grammarcrime.
Jason Derulo needs to stop saying Jason Derulo because he is not a Pok√©mon.
I'm becoming an avid bus surfer.
@santoslhalper YEEEEEAAAAAAA.
@toto I don't like that it does very little. Without extensions, you write a lot of boilerplate code that should be left to a library.
@scrappydoo FYI: my Jasmine book is still not released but will be arriving soon!
@santoslhalper I'll race you. I'm still in bed.
@lassie Depends. I don't like Backbone, but I had to use it once. Same with Ember. I like Knockout and Funnyface. Angular seems best.
@scrappydoo I admit I'm not an Angular man, so I can't be too helpful. It's on my to-do list of things to learn, though.
@pluto Does this interest you?
@dug I'd pay around a dollar (US) to summarize an article probably once a month.
The @pluto status page says everything operating normally, but I can't push/pull over SSH.
@rintintin Looks like it:.
Good luck getting all systems back online, @lassie.
@clifford Because Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework, it's not designed for testing private methods.
@hachiko What did you define as git yolo?
@santoslhalper It looks like they're being DDoS'd:.
@scrappydoo Looks like @scrappydoo is being DDoSed:.
@lassie It might have to do with the fact that they're being DDoSed:.
@balto Yup. Looks like they're being DDoSed:.

@eddie I believe the book isn't released. I'll let you know when it's out. You can read my quick guide for now:.
@toto Ember seems HUGE and kind of scary.
This bus driver is making it hard to surf, but I'm still able to type this with two hands while standing. Phew.
My professor kinda just wrote a shell in class. It was much shorter than I thought it'd be.
Blog post: Backbone.js is larger than you think.
Loki the cat!
The @scoobydoo is very impressive.
@pluto i have way too much work to have built this on a whim.
@lassie Could you break this down somehow?
Another Earth.
Twitter just told me to reconnect with someone so I unfollowed them.
@toto LOVE my Dell monitors. Good choice.
@dug How do I find archived lists and tasks?
@hachiko Tell me everything.
@eddie I'm slowly falling in love with Sublime. fyi.
Just spent about 10 seconds mashing Caps Lock repeatedly in an effort to make it function like the Tab key.
Thanks to @hachiko for telling me about Mosh!
Anyone have large-sized pixel art landscape wallpapers? Stuff like this  but a little larger.

@toto I just wanna tweet a lot so that I can see my logo.
@marmaduke @marmaduke Odd. Perhaps my (already-merged) pull request was in error.
The only thing I remember from my dream last night was that I paid $80 for a normal pizza.
@clifford Thank you!
@hachiko It's horrifying.
Leanne Busta Rhymes.
Thanks to @scoobydoo for my first-ever logo! Look at this thing! It's so sweet!
@scrappydoo ...very. I didn't get those results on OSX chrome.
@eddie Should I submit a pull request?
@toto Not that big a deal in Firefox, but I'd object to using Boolean because it's a reference type, right?
@eddie.
@marmaduke that looks pretty swee.
Resources I'd recommend.
@clifford EECS 270.
@rintintin what is the future like.
@santoslhalper Couldn't it also be var isChrome = !!window.chrome;?
For all of my *nix friends: use this. It will change you.
Awesome list of browser-specific hacks.
I'd rather be bus surfing.
I can't quite get the lighting right for this duckface selfie.
@scoobydoo not sure what that meant.
@clifford no, like you look nothing like her.
My music shuffle is KILLING it rn.
@toto That was the debate I had.
@pluto that looks nothing like you.
@marmaduke I can't intuitively imagine vomit exiting the passenger's seat and entering the driver's.
@hachiko from the passenger's seat to the driver's?
@hachiko jealous.
Holy gosh, Vimperator is SWEET.
Spring has graced Ann Arbor today.
@dug I hate MATLAB.
Settling a dispute.
Sentence fragment.
@dug That sounds like JavaScript and I'm sorry.
@toto LOVE the design of your site. Would you mind if I stole some of it for mine?
@hachiko Not sure. Gaining popularity (see  Testing and Benchmarking); Node out of the box; bit more difficult.
@balto @balto That's me.
I made yet another JavaScript class library: Classy.
@scrappydoo Sure.
Michigan, I am in you.

Props to Zenhabits for having no copyright.
There is so much cool stuff on this planet.
Typing this with two hands while bus surfing!
@rintintin Thanks! I might make it a Chrome extension.
I don't mean to brag, but let's just say that I put the E in JavaScript.
Even I can't fully appreciate how much I love KT Tunstall's music.
@clifford those are SO SICK.
I'm at a review session and the reviewer is using Emacs. I'm tempted to raise my hand and ask why he isn't using Vim.
@toto Join me in hating it.
@lassie It's a detailed process.
Evan Hahn: certified lover of the plum tea he bought from that cool Korean supermarket.
I know about Weird Twitter, but is there a Weird LinkedIn.
Every terms of service should look like this.

@toto exactly. I'm in bed for a longass time.
@snoopy Sorry, completely messed that up. Fermata.
A hub made entirely of gits.
@marmaduke It's more like my legato.
Because this is a half-semester course, the first exam I'm taking this semester is also a final.
@scoobydoo Weird little bug on the Wikipedia snippet.
Nobody here reads the git logs. So I've started adding things about my coworkers to my commits.
Java is to JavaScript as Car is to Carpet.
I wouldn't say that getting out of bed is my fort√©.
Well, this is spooky. Welcome to the Malware-Industrial Complex.
@balto.
OH: No, Java! No!
@dug I find indent guides very helpful. I use the Indent Guides plugin for Vim, and it's built into Sublime.
@toto I find the JS output very readable. There are ways to debug it directly that I should be doing, but I've never felt the need.
The @dug framework looks sweet.
All I want to do is write CoffeeScript code and ignore my C++ project.
This is how I feel about Java.
@scrappydoo ...how desperately?
Just wrote var instead of far. My transformation into JavaScript Man has begun.
CSS, I beg you, please.
These beats are inhumanely dope.
Ugh, Bungie's new game looks really sweet.
@pluto Looks like some stuff on there is outdated -jQuery is one example.
@scrappydoo pona!
Looks like @hachiko is down.
Ruby Kinda-Near Rails.
@snoopy On YouTube, yes.
How can you program if you're blind? I always wondered.
Back To The Ground @odie.
@pluto I think it's better now.
@toto Yeah, it's happening to me and a bunch of other people.
@clifford it's sweeeeeeeeee.
@balto.
@dug Seems like not, sadly.
@scrappydoo It's not just you, by the way -Facebook messages are down for lots of people (including me).
@lassie Yeah. A quick search on Twitter showed that we're not the only ones with the problem, it seems.
@balto Yeah -I think it's just Facebook that's weird right now.
@odie Seems like it -the same thing is happening to me.
@snoopy I'm having the same problem.
@odie Facebook Messages aren't working (and they're not just down for me, according to twitter).
@snoopy Yeah, mine aren't working either.
@lassie same thing is happening to me.
@clifford Yeah, it's happening to me.
iOS is overwhelmingly blue.
@toto I think you do. I'm not totally sure about the protocol. (Add me, though.).
Facebook inbox slow for anyone else? Messages won't load on my computer or phone.
@odie I am excited.
@rintintin I'm particularly fond of ALL OF IT.
@odie Is Fetchnotes written in CoffeeScript? If so, y'all should add it here:.
@lassie it's...beautiful.
@snoopy Thanks for translating -do feel better!
@hachiko Clever.
@santoslhalper Pretty sure I was quoting you.
@snoopy I'm learning  -could you translate that last sentence?

Just tried joining the @snoopy IRC. It is HOPPING in there.
The Road Not Taken is a stupid poem.
@odie Thanks for awesome!
@pluto Ah, sorry -it's called Taggify.
@dug students can use Virtual Sites to do cross-browser testing.
@balto Is Taggery something that should be blocked?

@santoslhalper still is.
@balto Was it in the morning? Because then it's Danger Zone.

@dug That one file is the only file in the project. My guess is that this is due to some Windows/Notepad++ wonkiness.
@pluto That seems odd; tonumber expects a string  and converts it to a number. Try changing it to tonumber(xyz, 10).
@balto What version of Lua are you using, and on what platform? I'm on a Mac and lua -v outputs Lua 5.1.4.
@marmaduke Just one file -call it whatever you want (tictactoe.lua, for example). Then run it from the command line (lua tictactoe.lua).
