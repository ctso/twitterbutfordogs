@scrappydoo I think that means you would be good at playing guitar?
@marmaduke the surroundings aka corpses.
I get a lot of enjoyment out of staring and making motor sounds with my voice when a car next to us revs it's engine.
@marmaduke Woaaah, that robot was just trying to do his job. Better outlaw hockey sticks.
Works in my container.
Wearing a new shirt to my tech job today. Hope I fit in.
@scrappydoo I think you meant to say podcast I liked.
Oatmeal really stepped up its game since the last time I had it.
@marmaduke It's all those non-domesticated trains that got loose.
@eddie @santoslhalper I buy a lot of car parts. I don't even drive anymore.
@eddie @santoslhalper I'm pretty sure that's how birthright works. You have to enforce it or you lose it.
Asked our Amazon Echo to play some music but had connection problems. Now my neighbor's playing what I asked the Echo to play.
@clifford I worked hard on that personalized note. I took a little inspiration from the prompt window though.
Jurassic World was great. Clever twist to splice T-Rex DNA with Jeff Goldblum's.
@scoobydoo you can't just decide that after 40 minutes. that's not even a fourth of the movie!
@clifford When I went to GenCon, there was a big motorcycle meetup. Streets lined with bikers and cosplayers.
Well this isn't creepy at all.
Looks like I'm not having the crab rangoon.
You can't just leave the Josie &amp; the Pussycats soundtrack on my desk and expect me to NOT play it for the rest of the night.
Are you saying 'not a cult' or 'not occult'? ...both?
@dug Ali had issues with hyphenated last name. System generated her username with a hyphen, then said she can't have a hyphen in it. A+.
@balto Does Dialoguer support creating Dialogue nodes programmatically at run time?
There are 6 Kevins at my client's office now. I'm scared we've reached Maximum Kevin and I'll cease to exist.
@odie Ali triple dog dared me, but then took it back when she saw I would actually go ask him. Not a coward, just married.
@odie Also, if it isn't Tom Selleck, my world would shatter.
@odie I've been trying to sneak a photo ask night but I am ashamed  / a coward.
Just danced next to a guy who looks like Tom Selleck.
There is a guy who looks JUST like Tom Selleck at this wedding.
@odie I haven't been able to add a second profile for Ali. Just says Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again. @pluto.
@hachiko First time I've had it happen on Windows 7. I was under the impression that it was a new feature of Windows 8 up until now.
Oh, that's ok, Windows. Go ahead and restart regardless of what I'm doing. I didn't have anything to do today. Whatever you need.
@santoslhalper Yes! You guys rock :).
@marmaduke @santoslhalper Loving having list view in folder/all unread! Any chance of getting the source site next to the item titles?
@marmaduke So close to using Hive as my daily reader. List view in All Unread and at the folder level would make it. So far so good though!
@marmaduke I've got some friends that want to join me on  My username is bifflechips :).
I guess there's a new pope? Bad day to pick it. News overshadowed by Veronica Mars Kickstarter starting up &amp; Google Reader shutting down.
@scoobydoo I own it. Nice day for a walk, too.
Awesome, now Chicago just needs a Skyline Chili.
@lassie I love messing with the sellers. I always ask what frites are, and after they explain say ...sooo fries then?
Woman in front of me at Starbucks just ordered 10 drinks, each as its own transaction.
I cannot express how much I hate the iTunes application for Windows.
This is reminiscent of the Love Actually gift wrapping scene.
Why is my already boxed Panera sandwich given to me in a large grocery bag?
@scrappydoo Florence from Florence &amp; the Machine was discovered in a bathroom. This guy just needs exposure.
@scrappydoo He's just singing what we're all thinking.
Dude in the public restroom singing Mambo No. 5.
@scoobydoo Congrats! Your prize is 94 cents.
@odie This particular one we stopped at on the way to Cincinnati ran out.
Arby's ran out of roast beef? Buh?
Buy 1 get 1 free drink at Starbucks? I'll have two Tall Pumpkin Spice Lattes in a Venti cup, please.
@odie Can you guys offer delivery where CAH isn't on the package? This is the third time I've failed to surprise my wife :(.
The vet just sent me a list of things that are dangerous to my pets, sung to the tune of These are a few of my favorite things.
Saw Skyfall last night, which was pretty cool. All of the high school kids at the Lake were not though.
@rintintin I received an invalid key for Battlefield 3 Premium. Support ticket  Could you please issue me a working key?
Testing days right before releases are so boring. I can't even FIX the bugs I find unless it's something breaking. Keep testing. Fix later.
@dug I think Ursula the Hutt is more likely.
OH: It's work-safe, but the site LOOKS very communist.
In Central Park. Pretty sure I've seen all of it already on SVU.
@pluto Enjoyed your seminar on Designing in Public. Picked up  but haven't gotten to play it yet. Love the look though.
Lunch is just something I do when I need a co-worker for something but they're out for lunch.
@lassie I'd love to see everyone and meet Soren, but I'm still working out in Itasca. Raincheck, but say hey for me.
@lassie @snoopy @scrappydoo @dug @toto @eddie was just thinking about that, Ali's family was playing Draw Something.
Asked a co-worker which finger he uses to right-click and he flicked me off. Guess it's a touchy subject.
@odie Ah, it's been bumped from worldwide for newer news.
@odie Dunno what you're talking about. Guild Wars 2 Release Date is today's big news.
Giving labels proper names in a huge report, and I get to the Recall column in the Totals row.
This weekend I realized that movies never have very many sex jokes in them until you watch them with your parents.
OH: I have this person I'm supposed to call named Michael Scarn, but the phone number looks weird. It looks like a bogus one.
@odie You say that about everything.
@odie That's cool. My suggestion was based on my first initials being KC. Some people would call me Casey when I was younger.
@odie Sadness. Are you guys not saying what it is for now? What about first letter? Might impact middle name choice.
@odie Did you guys pick a first name?
@odie Suggest names like Taco Bell and Doritos, then names like Mal will seem awesome in comparison.
@balto Yeah! That's the guy I saw!
Saw my first shooting star and a wild turkey this weekend.
Just saw a bald eagle outside of a zoo for the first time in my life.
Driving to MI. Left lane closed in 2 miles and everyone is getting into the right lane now. Has to have some kind of scientific explanation.
@balto I could outrun a centaur! Love your game, ArenaNet :).
@scrappydoo I'll be sure to tell past me tomorrow so that he knows that I know that it is the life.
@scrappydoo Are you me from my future of exactly one day?
@scrappydoo That would be awesome. Let's make it happen.
@scrappydoo Jealous. It's beta weekend for Guild Wars 2 and I'm at work. On the other hand, I do get to play some midnight whirlyball.
@scoobydoo @odie I look forward to the proof of knowing what everyone has ever thought. AMAZE ME, MIKE.
What's the deal with NBC shows and the name Kevin tonight? Must be payback for that George Takei voicemail from Community.
@odie Can't. I'm too busy CREATING.
@odie @clifford OMG! I can't believe that just happened.
@balto Ah! I was thinking about that show last night, wondering when it was going to start. Thanks :).
Heads up, Avatar: The Legend of Korra starts tomorrow morning. Been a while since I got up for Saturday morning cartoons.
@scoobydoo Scumbag Cthulhu. Claims to undo reality. Haunts a single house instead.
@scrappydoo It's cool, just cleansing houses of the animated corpses of previous tenants that are trying to lichify themselves. No biggie.
All of the players managed to survive our Call of Cthulhu game last night, and only two of them went insane. Temporarily.
Ran my first Call of Cthulhu game tonight and none of my players' characters went insane. I probably did it wrong.
@odie In response to your 9,000th tweet, I'm sharing this comic with you:.
@balto Nah, that's not it. Your body is just trying to tell you to preorder Guild Wars 2.
@marmaduke Yes! I refused to finish the single player without 100% readiness. Engineer and Adept are my favorite. Also, Krogan headbutts!
@marmaduke Thank you for an awesome series! Mordin's storyline is my favorite. While I would prefer more closure, I still loved my ending.
@rintintin Thank you for the spoiler warning on today's news post. It is much appreciated.
@clifford She's probably just embarrassed.
In all this Mass Effecting, I forgot to eat dinner. Classic me.
Beat Mass Effect 2 for the second time tonight. Maximum Renegade, maximum awesome.
@odie Hah. I totally changed your tweet from P'owned to P'zoned with my mind.
Disaster Recovery Plan tested over the weekend. Disaster ensues on Monday. Caused by the Recovery Plan. What.
@snoopy Oh man, Justified is so good. It's only gotten better with each season, too.
@clifford @odie I know, right?!
@odie I think it's clear that you need to make a Pizza Hut Alliance, for trade agreement purposes.
@odie Those are safe. That's what you should have ordered in the first place. Now I want a P'zone @clifford.
@odie Well, you only have so much time. He'll know Operation Poisonzone failed when he doesn't see you in the Obituaries.
@odie This was delivery? He knows where you live. You gotta get out of there!
@odie This sounds like a Seinfeld episode.
@odie I hope this turns into a full scale  Manager starts buying up your favorite restaurants. Hangs NO BENS signs.
@odie Maybe you should just learn how to make calzones? I'll bet there's even a way to make them cold.
@odie Here's my friend Kevin. He's really funny. Do something funny, Kevin. fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
@odie It's too late. The joke's too obvious now :(.
@odie I want to make a Muffin/Calzone man joke here, but I don't know if you've seen enough Arrested Development to get it.
@hachiko working on moving some devblog stuff over, I'll link ya when I can.
@hachiko Been working on a turn-based tactics game.
I just lost to my own AI. Not sure how I feel right now.
No idea how I missed a new Asteroids Galaxy Tour album. Happy weekend!
@hachiko I'm pretty sure Leonardo Da Vinci kept all of his crazy LEGO designs in a Moleskine.
@snoopy Pay your Comcast bill?
@odie I have watched all of the seasons that are on Netflix. It is excellent.
@odie Did not seem true to the series at all.
@odie I'm sure Juan hasn't seen it yet, but I'll say I wasn't happy with how it ended either.
@santoslhalper @eddie  This is more of a winter solution  I was given the skully for christmas, to fit under my helmet.
At the D&D table: What do you mean I don't know the command word? I brute force it. Aardvark...
@odie In short: Google can share information about you with itself. Am I reading this wrong or is that it?
@odie Oh man, I love freaking out Tux. Since his hair is longer, it covers up any kind of grip he could get with his paws.
@odie Ali's mom bought me the Tooks hat that fits under a helmet for xmas. Works pretty well. Nice find.
@odie sounds good to me. I want to take a road trip to Dayton in a few weeks, too. Eh, @scoobydoo?
NFL supports SOPA? Finally, a reason I can tell my family why I don't watch football and have them not look at me funny ...maybe.
Someone here just used the word grandpuppy. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
@odie Cool, thanks a lot!
@odie Thanks. Do you know what sizes your monitors are?
@balto That sounds like a personal problem.
While testing Android voice apps, asked one What's the traffic like right now? and it showed me a picture of John Wayne.
@clifford Hahaha, that's awesome. Sadly, I haven't had time to start book 3 yet.
Oh hey, look. Mass Effect 3 has a Collector's Edi...SOLD.
@clifford Get Battlefield 3, duh.
@clifford Spoilers: it's awesome.
@scrappydoo Looks like google reader syncing is currently broken because of the update, but hopefully that will get fixed soon.
@scrappydoo haha, I JUST got to that website when I saw your message pop up.
I've about had it with Google Reader. What are other people using as their (non-Apple-only) RSS reader?
@lassie Relevant: PLEASE make the defibrillator less of a pain to kill with? People won't wait around for me to shock them to death.
@clifford @odie It's like we're 40-year-olds and Google just shut down Usenet.
@odie But I agree, it's dumb if I have to +1 something first before I share it. I share too many dumb things that don't deserve +1.
@odie I'm guessing there's a Share with Google Plus! one out or coming soon.
@odie I dunno, but all of your followers who also follow me do now (but I doubt they didn't already know that).
@odie You have to +1 it, then you can share it on Google Plus. I've got you guys in your own Circle. I don't like it, But it works.
@odie They've dubbed that feature  subscription export.
@odie I know, and the font got a little bigger (unless I was using an extension for that, which is now broken).
Oh. I get it. This is their way of encouraging me to use Google+.
Google Reader just updated, and now I'm not finding Shared Items anywhere @pluto My shares. You has them. But where are they?
@scoobydoo trying to fly a helicopter with mouse and keyboard is horrible.
Operation Battlefield-3-Weekend Status: Success. Secondary Objective: Flight Training. Status: Failure. Joystick inbound.
@lassie Engineers are hanging out of helicopters repairing them. Impossible to take them down, even if disabled. Please fix this.
@hachiko oh man, that's tough. I'd probably go with the PS3 version if that's where you can play with people you know. Squad up!
@scrappydoo I'm addicted. It looks amazing on my PC, and I'm a sucker for a strategic squad-based FPS.
Last person just left the office. Be advised, Battlefield 3 weekend has begun.
Sent the bug back telling them it won't be a problem for almost 8000 years. Debated setting the status to On Hold.
Upload breaks when I enter 4/3/17989 for the expiration date [sic]. Does it, QA? DOES IT?!
@balto I assumed this was the case.
@balto You've made a huge mistake.
Friday afternoon fire drill. At least it's not raining.
Comcast put me on TriplePlay +$15 to bill. Didn't want Phone -&gt; didn't complete 3rd party agreement -&gt; not getting charged. Bill cut in half.
Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Scones, Pumpkin Pie, Dogfish Head Punkin Ale... I love Fall.
@dug I think Comcast is a stupid company that sucks, but switched from AT&T after I had basically the exact same problem as you.
@dug Was on the phone w/ Comcast all weekend. Somehow out of that they managed to make my bill go up $15. Called too late to fix today.
@scoobydoo That's ridiculous, you loved Fuego Loco!
@odie This is just about what name both go under, isn't it? Streaming and DVD are still separate plans, if I'm not being dumb.
@odie Haha, awesome! You have a gym near you or is this outdoors?
Shamelessly stolen idea from @scrappydoo.
@clifford I wasn't saying e-ink as opposed to actual books. Nook and Kindle both have a color tablet version now.
@clifford Your biggest question is, if you want to get the current generation of either one, is free 3G important to you?
@clifford Are you looking at just e-ink?
@odie Getting married is so 2-3 weeks ago.
@clifford @balto @odie It's dericious. Get some.
@odie Then why didn't they pick a better twitter name.
@odie @balto @clifford tell me how the Arctic Panzer Wolf is, wherever that stupid bar is.
@odie I tried to get some Arctic Panzer Wolf from a place that had it on tap, but they had just run out. Let me know how it is.
California store told me b/c I live in Chicago, It takes 5 days to ship to East Coast. I guess it's East Coast if it doesn't touch Pacific.
@scrappydoo  Does not seem like the time to suggest a twitter account.
@scrappydoo A Wendy's basement? Only reason I can think of for being there is you were all abducted by a crazy manager...
@dug 5 people, but last night 2 of us also hopped in on our Android phones while being logged in on our computers, so 7.
@dug I can't make the hangout, but some friends and I have been using Hangouts to play D&D from 3 different states (usually 5 of us).
@odie Oh no! It's not a secret anymore!
Why didn't anyone tell me it was International Talk Like a Pirate Day?!
Received compliments on my shirt leaving O'Hare and SFO. I'm clearly more fashionable than @odie would ever admit.
hog trough dance? wtf weddings?!
@odie I am excited for upcoming hoodie weather.
Under my Jones Soda cap: By next month, your responsibilities will be alleviated.
@odie Depends on the tip :P.
@odie At some point the cheese level gets pretty ridiculous, but it comes back down. Excited for the new season.
@odie Psych also came out before Dexter.
@odie Been a while since I saw the 1st season. It's more a procedural show than about Shawn's character development.
@odie I'm not sure why 3 is a reason the show isn't awesome. Is it because it's not Dexter?
@odie Do they actually believe he's psychic in the first season? I thought the police are just ok with it because he gets results.
@scoobydoo Do you have webcams in Texas?
@balto @odie  I hated Monk but I love Psych.
@odie That show is awesome. If I were a few years older, it'd be even better because I'd understand more of their weird references.
@dug That's awesome! I love their books (and Rails!).
@balto There is, but I didn't have the time to stop over there this morning.
The office coffee tastes a little soapy today. Sadly, this is an improvement.
@scoobydoo No, you always expect I'm out to get you guys when I'm DMing.
@scoobydoo As the main offender, you would. :P.
@balto When it's understood between the players and myself as the GM that we're on the same side, we tend to have a lot more fun.
@balto Remember that you are playing alongside your party, not against them :P.
@balto If you've got any questions, I would be happy to try to answer them. I can write down tips as they come to mind during games, too.
@clifford @balto I know, right? I showed him how to play over a year ago.
How was work today, sweetie? It was great. I indented 8000 lines of text.
Someone nearby is repeatedly making the same three keystrokes. That same someone needs to learn how to use macros.
@balto @scoobydoo Mmm, Urgot Choffee.
@balto Tell your dad to quit drinking water and start drinking coffee.
@balto Lawful Good is best good.
The best time to have an Amazon Prime membership is when your AC breaks. Would you like to spend $4 to have it by tomorrow? Duh.
@balto did you tell her where she could pick up her Darwin award?
@odie were you retweeted on anyone's public timeline?
On the plus side, I think we found our Wedding DJ this weekend.
@scoobydoo This has been a problem with the electricity in our apartment since the summer started. I e-mailed the landlord about it.
@scoobydoo Leverage isn't on the DVR, so the power went out before last night.
24 hours and a new car later, we're finally home to find our power went out while we were gone. Greeted by a lack of AC and some angry cats.
@scoobydoo It's a newer version of @hachiko 's car. Thanks for the recommendation Juan :).
What a day. Looks like we're buying a new car.
Car broke down on the way back to Chicago. Staying in a hotel for tonight. Hopefully we can get it fixed and head home tomorrow.
@scoobydoo you finally get a new apartment?
@odie Top reason to use Google+: It's not Facebook.
Played the Arkham Horror board game for the first time last night. We did not finish, but we know the rules now. I liked it a lot.
@hachiko @scrappydoo Finally unlocked Unstoppable Wizard last night.
@clifford Ali got so angry at me the other day when I forgot to eat. She's just jelly of my sweet body.
@snoopy @scrappydoo But Chris was on the winning team. Now the text is inconsistent with the result of the game.
@odie Needed to populate a relationship table between two tables who's rows were initially all related to each other.
Three and a half years after graduating, I used a cross join for the first time today.
@scrappydoo @hachiko @snoopy @dug The 2nd is best for me as well. In town for sure that weekend.
@scrappydoo I'm actually in town the next two weekends, so that would work. Been going out of town a lot lately for wedding planning.
@scrappydoo Plays really well. I'm still working out past O'Hare, so I'd only be able to make it in to the city after the workday.
@odie so many parts of your world.
Just downloaded  on my new EVO 3D. My first purchase. :) @scrappydoo @eddie.
@scoobydoo Sorry, seems like it's more serious than I first thought :( Is it your practice space?
@scoobydoo Don't you mean grimy? :P.
@odie How I Met Your Mother season finale SO GOOD.
@snoopy Buying one for a friend, will I get two posters if I have two pre-orders in my cart?
Rarely happens, but I love adding comments after the continue condition for a loop that needs to run exactly 3 times. i &lt;3:.
@balto @scoobydoo That is clearly a hypocritical troll.
@scoobydoo But it isn't really instant. If you know what you're searching for, are you not typing fast enough?
@balto @scoobydoo tweeted an explanation, so I wasn't sure.
@scoobydoo @balto And just to be clear, you are aware it was a joke, yeah?
@scoobydoo What do you not like about Instant?
@scrappydoo Agreed. Mr. T is from Chicago, after all. And Boeing's in Seattle. Where my location-based searching at, Google??
The Konami Code on google.com gives me Boeing's stock price. Not a very good easter egg, in my opinion.
@scoobydoo Hahaha, sounds like he was trolling all of his followers.
@scoobydoo Oh, I'm so sorry. How did those get in there? In this next slide...
Ali told me to quit trolling her whole family. I told her no you. Then I fixed all of their computers.
@clifford To find more and better coffee?
@clifford @odie @balto  Wow, were you guys up early for the rapture?
@lassie How do you get newer evidence for bible-based calculations?
It's New Laptop Day, which makes me happy. Unfortunately, it's also Learn New Keyboard Day, which makes me sad.
@odie I'm sure they're going to just claim to be bad at math.
@odie Are you trying to convince me to go to church? Because it's working.
@odie It's just a viral marketing campaign. They found out their JESUS IS REAL. REPENT. billboards/barns weren't very effective.
@scoobydoo You had creativity over me at least :P.
@scoobydoo @balto  patented inb4mike.
@balto That's just flavor germs.
@odie Always hold out for Section 9. Right, @balto ?
@balto @odie The trick is to ask it this way: What, specifically, are we forgetting?
Sad that Pixar went with Cars to do a sequel this year instead of The Incredibles. On the other hand, Bruce Campbell voices a new character.
@clifford *shrug* Have to handle it somewhere, and it's programmer's preference.
@clifford That's why you have a hidden field with the same name set to False.
@balto Landscape feels more comfortable, and I make fewer mistakes.
@dug Can we get a Double Trouble Trundle/Rumble Double Double Bundle?
@clifford Did you beat the Elite Four?!
@scoobydoo I don't see a problem with that.
@odie That's because it's his dad.
@odie you forgot the hashtag.
@eddie Hah, they're alright. I need to get back to that series. I branched into the Cleric Quintet at some point.
@odie yeah, it helps me align my chakras.
@odie never unprotect your tweets.
Bug: Javascript error for users that have apostrophes in their name. Workaround: Fire all Irish and Elven employees.
@clifford @odie @balto I rolled a 4. The Cylons won.
@clifford We only had 3 people, and I was Gaius, so as soon as someone became a Cylon in the sleeper phase I knew. Threw him in the brig.
Played the BSG board game for the 1st time tonight. Entire thing came down to one roll on a d8 with a 50% chance of humans or cylons winning.
Alright, Amazon seems to be confused as to what a Dune Buggy is, and what a Go-Kart is. CHALLENGE PREVENTED.
Ali just bet me that I *wouldn't* put a Dune Buggy on our Registry. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
@scoobydoo I'm going to have to write a script that filters that out of her browser until she gets her own 3DS.
@scoobydoo Yeah, if Ali didn't play so much Zelda all the time, I'd feel burned by the Wii. I can at least trade my DSLite for credit to 3DS.
I'm going to play lots of @toto  tonight so Portal 2 releases sooner, and I can stop having to listen to people talk about it sooner.
@scoobydoo They've also got a DSi mode, still in beta I think, but gives supported games more CPU & memory, smoother and better FPS.
@scoobydoo I have no intention of using the 3D. That's probably because of the upscale for the screen res.
@scoobydoo I saw you tried out the 3DS, what did you think? I'm considering picking one up. My DSLite is dying and I want WPA2 compatibility.
@balto You're right. You'll never get another chance, because you'll never go back to Boston Stoker. Ever. Also, time zones and work.
@scoobydoo Are you referring to the 3DS or that their next-gen console will actually be more powerful than current-gen consoles?
@balto Quick! Write The cake is a lie over everything.
@balto @scoobydoo Don't you mean *an* irony?
@balto I hope all of the emails you received were about the bug tracker's mailer being broken. That would be so coincidental.
@scoobydoo Trance is the better one in my opinion. House is too noisy, dance is too distracting.
@scoobydoo I've started using a last.fm station with keyword dubstep.
@balto @scoobydoo It was a quote from our D&D game tonight.
Worst comes to worst, we become vampires and get sweet powers.
@clifford The tweet after that is the one that makes me sad :(.
@odie @balto Tear wraps?
@balto Because not all apps go free.
@balto I think most apps are cheaper there everyday than in the android market.
@balto Ali's cousin was practically laughing when he explained it to me.
@odie All are forgiven except loss of interest in Castle.
@odie Was hoping there was an episode of Fringe on friday that DVRed. Sadly, there wasn't :(.
@snoopy Hah, thanks for reminding me I need to watch the rest of Party Down :P.
@scoobydoo @clifford Convincing? Sounds good to me.
@snoopy @scrappydoo @dug I've only seen the first two episodes of Party Down, so I can't comment on how alike they are.
@scrappydoo It was never a show I thought I would like, but a friend recommended it. Now I wish there was more.
@dug @scrappydoo Veronica Mars is three seasons and created by the same people who did Party Down. Ali and I liked it a lot.
@odie I imagine that would be a bit unwieldy.
@balto @odie I'm surprised @clifford hasn't jumped in to say lol DayAir rulez! u noobs! :P.
@odie I got an email about mine being compromised too. Have all of your emails been about the same provider?
@clifford I knew true happiness last night.
@odie ...browser-based Web surfing. o_O.
@balto Awesome. Weaksauce. C'mon.
@balto What starter? How many badges? Pokedex count?
@balto I can understand that. But you don't want to play pokemon? wat?
@balto I am proud to say that I have never been to New Jersey.
@balto Worst layover ever?
@scoobydoo I love that website. Ali got this one for me a while back.
Just got back from seeing The Adjustment Bureau with @odie. Loved it.
@scoobydoo Lookin' sick and sexy-fied.
@scoobydoo Got that glitter on my eyes.
Kevin, is Pikachu famous? (Ali's younger cousin).
@odie Oh wow. I can usually handle half of one before I feel full.
@odie Oh man. I can't remember which one's were my favorite, but I think Peanut Butter or Cream Cheese sounds right.
@odie Are you saying you've never had Killer Brownies before? :(.
@clifford @odie Juan knows how to set a scene with hashtags. It's romantic, really.
@odie both of those things &gt; poor hash tag use.
@odie I fail to see what your last tweet has to do with the hit NBC show Community.
@eddie I can't find the map this forum post refers to, even though I'm an Insider. Would love help finding it!
Fixed our toilet with a keychain ring.
@balto Agreed! Gouda taim!
@clifford When did I say it was bad? Cheesy != Bad.
@odie I have. It's alright. It's not quite as cheesy as Chuck. The bad guys haven't been as cool as I had hoped they'd be.
@scoobydoo It did shut me down for 1 1/2 days. I sunk to the level of thievery though.
@scoobydoo I managed to make it out of my parking spot this morning by stealing the neighbor's shovel & replacing it before they woke up.
@odie @scoobydoo my office is closed tomorrow, so I have to take the day off. shazbot.
@clifford Warwick and feeder?
@scoobydoo I still prefer the first, self-titled album, but Pow Pow is a great track.
@pluto I'd like to know where you got the Nice Tweets shirt!
@odie That'd be one awesome goat, though.
@odie The drive in wasn't that bad. I have a work meeting after I finish at the client (but it can start w/o me), so no big deal.
@odie All the snow is in Chicago. All of it.
@scoobydoo Oh man, True Grit was awesome. Enjoy!
Been using jQuery more than .NET on my current project lately. Hooray! Programming is fun again!
@clifford You've already played more than twice as many games as I have. I can't keep up!
@scrappydoo A powerful masculine voice whispered sweet updates of my pizza to me while I waited, too.
Good news everyone! The Domino's pizza tracker has added themes! I tracked my pizza using the bollywood theme.
@balto Agreed. Fix them, @scoobydoo.
@scoobydoo Were you wearing a brojacket like @clifford or a pair of Broakleys(tm)?
@scoobydoo @clifford agreed. why?
Finally have a comfortable chair at work. Whenever someone leaves at this client, everyone hits his desk like vultures.
Burn Notice season finale was amazing.
Watched all of Toy Story 3 without tearing up. Today I am a man.
@balto LIKE A BOSS.
@balto typical wednesday night.
@odie blegh, didn't see that you won the kindle. ...what I actually meant was Congratulations, winner!
@odie so get a Nook?
@clifford Yesss. Good answer. @odie.
@clifford Why did you wake up at 4AM? You better not have started playing WoW again.
@clifford How far did you get in your NaNoWriMo this year?
@clifford I like both. We'll have to check the google doc.
@scoobydoo @odie when are we making our dinomite/mart-force/cyberzombie game?
@odie So does the Nook. I have the same crappy phone data service that you have, but for free!
@balto @clifford Bought. Will go into pile of things to eventually play once at some point.
@scoobydoo Your turn again for the game, you still busy? What do?
@toto Just finished it. Awesome episode :).
@snoopy Was it really that bad? I thought it was awesome when he ended his final show by telling people not to be cynical.
@balto This happened to me too. I'm already looking for a new place to go for lunch today.
Ah! Merged the last 6 months of work back into the main branch in an hour. Amazing. Having trouble deciding if that's a good or bad sign.
@balto Playing D&D helps me.
@balto Work's been stressful lately. Need something to keep my mind occupied.
@scoobydoo The Kirby Dance always helps.
@clifford @balto @odie @scoobydoo I'm ready to play Dark Sun to help keep me sane. Get your characters up :P.
Just realized I've been sitting here for two hours with my earbuds in, listening to NOTHING.
@balto There's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes those are the best names.
@balto What are you talking about? Jim Thunderbrow is classic.
Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear live stream:.
@lassie Sounds like fun. Just need to find a time I can make it downtown during the week, or a time in OP.
@lassie I'm not a parent, so I probably just don't understand. She was also taking pictures and sending them to her sister. Normal?
This real friday is much better than yesterday's fake friday.
Anyone who can deliver me George Takei's voicemail message from tonight's Community episode gets my eternal gratitude.
Why are gov't warnings on beer qualified with According to the Surgeon General...? As if someone's going to say Pfft, what does he know?
@odie Dual crossbow wielding is gonna be aaaaawesoooome.
Someone is shooting nails into the ceiling directly beneath my desk chair. Least comfortable work day ever.
@scoobydoo @clifford Denying being a hipster is a clear sign of being a hipster.
@scoobydoo @clifford So you're saying they WEREN'T hipsters, then?
@scoobydoo @clifford Why were you across the street?
@scoobydoo Why did you buy a didgeridoo?
Finally playing some  tonight. It's been too long.
@odie Only cool if you said Return from whence you came as you threw them. Otherwise, you're a littering asshole.
@scrappydoo Time Crisis! That list is almost 50% fighters, though.
@odie Are you at a computer science convention in Puerto Rico?
@snoopy Joy Yee's Noodles in Chinatown.
Wow. This is the biggest bowl of Udon I've ever seen.
I was woken up today by a man cutting the street with a massive circular saw.
If you don't want to receive phone calls from us, you must provide us with the home telephone number we should not contact.
Can't believe no one has wished me a happy programmer's day today.
@clifford Snow's not as bad. And the voice actor is the same as the main human in GW2!
@clifford @odie GUIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLDDDDDD WAAAAAAAARRRRRS!
@balto @rintintin Any word on when the store will be back up? My bday is soon, I'd rather my family bought from you than through Amazon.
@scrappydoo Too late. Twitter's over. You missed it.
Played the drums on my desk for about 5 minutes before I even realized it. Sorry everyone in my cube area.
@odie I had one of those. My idea that someone else already thought of  Think Matt was the one that showed me.
@eddie If I were the one creating the stylesheets, I'd understand. It's because I'm using 3rd party stuff that does it that I'm angrified.
You can create up to 31 styleSheet objects with createStyleSheet method. The method then returns an Invalid Argument exception What? WHY.
@scoobydoo That is the hobo's version of a slick.
Client is telling me to store a 30 megabyte file in SQL session state, a result of having to click too many times on the page. Kill me.
@scrappydoo I have never gotten mine to work properly, either. No idea why this hasn't been fixed.
@clifford @balto @scoobydoo @odie (did you take AT, Ben?) and I are offended.
@rintintin @scrappydoo I'm with Sarah. Nothing to climb but buildings around here.
Net Neutrality's main opposition is complete ignorance on the subject.
Tea Party came out against Net Neutrality b/c it's more gov't regulation, saying Net Neutrality thwarts free speech rights of ISPs. FFS.
@balto @odie had the CySurg implant cameras in his cat's eyes before he left. Don't go to the bathroom.
@scoobydoo Well, if you're mostly just planning to play at home, FFXIII might be the better choice (and cheaper, apparently).
@scoobydoo that's a good point. think you'll be playing more at home or out and about as well?
@scoobydoo The intro to FFXIII is about half of the game. It's completely linear, but I still enjoyed it (the ~25 hours I played).
@scoobydoo If you have a LOT of time to kill, FFXIII. If you want to jump in, and not have to deal with crappy characters like Hope, DQIX.
@balto all typical cat behavior, from my experience.
Picked up the 1st volume of Chew before I left San Francisco. Read it all on the flight and loved it. Now I have to order Volume 2.
@odie Hah! Boston Stoker was my guess before I checked the picture from the Dayton Airport.
@clifford @odie @balto I'm planning on making it out to Dayton Aug. 20-22. Bug Mike enough and he might come, too.
@snoopy @hachiko @balto @scoobydoo Noddin' my head like yeaaah. Movin' my hips like yeaaah.
@balto why are you at a starbucks?
@odie Congrats from the west coast! We'll be drinking already, but I'll raise my beer in a silent toast.
Finally found some single color origami sheet packs in Japantown.
@balto I picked it up when it first dropped, but the drawer interface bothered me. It's much better now. Only complaint is twitpic use.
My safety gets in the way of all of my fun.
Waiting for checked baggage is really cramping my style.
@balto @odie I read everything in my own narcissistic voice.
Loving this Automata storyline. Great job Ben Caldwell @hachiko @balto @rintintin.
@santoslhalper Holy crap, these are the best pens I have ever used in my life  This must be my oddest sincere tweet ever.
People keep joining this conference call every 5 seconds. Performance levels are at an all-time *BEEP-BLOOP*.
I hope this is done before my birthday. I& like to go home by October.
My only knowledge of Mad Men is that one of the guest stars from 30 Rock is in it and.
@clifford Awesome! I'm excited. I'd like to see some Sam Axe character development.
@scrappydoo @snoopy Personally, I feel it needs more, gruesome deaths. I'll still be picking it up tonight, though.
@scrappydoo Haven't tried that with my 360 yet. Odds are one of us will know what we're doing.
@scoobydoo Ah, well here's my spoiler-free review: Awesome.
@scoobydoo @odie and I grabbed the last volume and finished it yesterday. What'd you think?
@snoopy @hachiko @scrappydoo Sounds good to me. Large bet on myself in versus mode.
@balto Bar graphs kill people.
@balto What about a bar graph that says Yes 100% to the question Do bar graphs lie?
Would love to get the new Chicane album. Physical CD is sold out on Amazon, and none of the MP3 stores have it.
@scoobydoo What did you think of the person with an iPad?
@odie See Pirates of Silicon Valley.
@odie You make a better Steve Jobs than Noah Wyle ever did.
@odie That was my impression as well, until Gizmodo's quote from Steve Jobs said differently.
If the newest iPhone update fixes the antenna, why the free case?
Congrats to iPhone 4 owners, they just won a free case!
@scrappydoo You are in for a treat.
Apparently my tweet about the blinds in Leverage last night made a blogger for curtains follow me. LOOKING AT YOU @dug.
Offices in  always have quick-pull style blinds. Guess it's better than actors slowly turning a plastic thing as it squeaks em shut.
My dog's name is going to be Megabyte.
@hachiko Same here. Intentionally avoided the first 90 seconds video that was floating around so it's more exciting tonight.
I need to start storing an inflatable raft in my car, so I can get to the apartment from my parking spot. That or, you know, boots.
How much rain does it take to sink Chicago?
@pluto I can't deny the cornhole/anus relation. Most people will attribute the game to Cincinnati, and while stupid, use their name.
My mom (a teacher) played World of Warcraft for a class she's taking. Asked her if the class was sponsored by Blizzard. Her reply: What?
@pluto I guess if you want to call Cincinnati Way down south. I always get funny looks when I ask people what they mean by Bags.
@scrappydoo Stella's sister :P.
Completely unrelated: Anyone in the market for a used '95 Chevrolet Beretta? Recently replaced coolant Like New!
@scrappydoo We brought up @marmaduke Saturn SL2. Classy.
Finally, my personal favorite: When I make a slight left turn, the car won't shift into neutral.
When I release the brake & hit the accelerator, the brakes won't stick, causing my car to pounce forward.
I'll be able to relax in air conditioning that works, instead of driving on the highway with the windows down.
I'll be able to see if cars are coming in the driver's side mirror instead of having to jerk my neck to look.
@scoobydoo I'll collaborate (and listen) with @scoobydoo.
Once I'm in the car, I won't need to pop the hood to replace the coolant that leaked out during the workday.
When I leave work today, I will be getting into my car from the driver's side door, not the passenger side.
@santoslhalper @scoobydoo of course this is blocked where I work.  :( please record!
@lassie is it still out in oak park? We had to leave for Cincinnati friday night :(.
I'm finally moving to a new cubicle, away from the people talk about their dogs all day. Productivity just went up a million billion percent.
I wish the person I'm working with was taller. He's never in his cubicle, but I can never tell.
@odie I don't think I'd do any of those things on a Saturday and probably not a Sunday (haven't had to go to church in a long time).
@odie saw an ad on the El where a fast food place had partnered with Mafia Wars on FB. You get a free mafia thing with your food :(.
@scrappydoo I got it for $10 off, which I would say was definitely worth it. I hate the GTAs but I like RDR. Nothing revolutionary, but fun.
@hachiko So what's your opinion on the Evo after a day or so?
Successfully herded baby bunny away from traffic, back into the apartment courtyard. Herding cattle in Red Dead Redemption all day paid off.
@odie I couldn't stop myself. Intentionally misinterpreting questions is too funny to me. Real answer: *shrug*.
@odie I guess so, what's the offensive term you're avoiding?
@hachiko Now quick, root it and install Froyo so it's even FASTER.
@balto That means you'll have good luck today!
Horrible traffic driving home. Decided to stop in Elmhurst for BW's & Jamba Juice. Hooray.
@clifford The comics are good, too! The sixth (and final) one comes out soon.
@odie that last crash? Right in front of us. I almost caught a piece of debris.
@odie we just sat down. Have you seen @toto yet?
@odie we're tailgating now, gonna be somewhere near turn 1. I'm told we'll have a good view of the high-probability crash area.
@odie I'm going to be there too for some reason.  Where will you be?
@balto I bet waiting in line at our post office is worse today.
@balto @odie Get back to work.
Cubs players get paid to deal with fans more than they do to play baseball.
Finally found a spot at my desk that gets my phone good enough reception to listen to  all day.
@scoobydoo Someone should tell him his strings are upside down.
In a productive mood today, but I'm stuck watching status bars while setting up an environment for a new work project.
C'mon, Microsoft. You're killing me.
No time for lunch outside to read Scott Pilgrim :( Maybe tomorrow.
@scoobydoo Hoodie. It's been between 60-80F last few weeks.
@scrappydoo Congratulations on the engagement! Missed this over the weekend.
Nantucket Necatars under the cap: Nantucket is not a part of Kentucky. Now they are just getting lazy.
@odie Apparently he's bumping George Lopez to midnight. I would say it's irony, but in this case no one likes the George Lopez show.
@odie How can they call it breaking news if Conan already broke the story?
@scoobydoo Only an idiot would come back looking like himself. If you met, you'd either go into shock or create a time paradox.
@scoobydoo Maybe they were separate copies of you from the future.
@scoobydoo I leave a note on my fridge.
@odie YouTube needs an Auto DJ.
Free cone day at Ben & Jerry's! (between noon & 8PM).
OH at the office Do you think it's possible for a printer to get bogged down with, like, cookies?
@hachiko come to chicago, bookstores know to stock rpgs here.  yes that's a pokedex next to pathfinder core.
@ all my Emmis friends:  Practice for next season?
@odie I had that same revelation last year. Isn't it AMAZING?
Big Lebowski Alignment Chart (possibly NSFW).
@scrappydoo from what I've heard, you usually don't see it again after the first rrod.
@scrappydoo I got mine back in 2 weeks. Mine just red-ringed last month.
@odie You mean Lexii?
Back from Arizona, and I brought a cold with me :(.
@scrappydoo good call, it is :) we have plenty of pictures of us looking silly.
I'm higher up than you are!
We killed the world!
Asia is about to asplode.
There are a lot of rules for Pandemic that follow the form If ______, the game immediately ends in defeat for all players.
@scoobydoo The lead falls were so we get used to falling. I don't think I was supposed to get that close to the ground though.
Took my first lead climbing practice fall today, as did @marmaduke. I stopped inches from the ground. Epic.
Cyclist almost hit me & gave me a stare like I was at fault: I was parked getting into my car. You were moving. Handlebars are for steering.
Hate the people at UPS who stand at the counter in front of everyone sitting patiently. Love the UPS workers that ignore them.
@balto It's just that old.
I must be the only person in this building that drinks Mountain Dew (sometimes). My can has an ad for a movie that came out June 2009.
Someone I don't know from Columbus just butt-dialed me. Hi butt!
@balto Chicago has a suburb that is bigger than Dayton.
@odie I guess they haven't heard of the Pre in Dayton.
Sorry if you received an e-mail from me about Google Buzz. Not sure why it's automatically e-mailing people.
@rintintin I have the same problem plus a redringed 360 currently residing at Microsoft. I had my fiance hide Mass Effect 2 in the meantime.
@balto @odie I haven't been craving coffee, either. Although if Boston Stoker ever opens up in Chicago, I'm doomed.
@scoobydoo I read the end of the Death Note manga last night. It sucked just a little less than the anime.
@scoobydoo pics or bearcat isn't real anymore.
The woman at UPS said they get about 4 or 5 red-ringed 360s to ship to Microsoft for repair EVERY DAY.
@clifford I already had Mass Effect 1 for the 360. From what I saw of the PC version, I preferred it on the 360, reverse of Dragon Age.
@scoobydoo I am all out of timedogs. TIMETUX NOOOOOO.
Blegh. My 360 finally red-ringed on me today. I ordered Mass Effect 2 two days ago. I hope the box art is good? At least the repair is free.
@odie Depends. Is that plate across from you the person you're sharing it with? Then no :P.
I'm not sure why the maintenance crew needs a hammer to paint our apartment hallway.
@scoobydoo I don't get it. It's a big version of an iPod that costs more than my netbook, but is capable of less.
@clifford You somehow manage to login and actually do something on the days that the CPU usage peaks.
@snoopy Usually Sundays. Working on a webapp that has a mixed play-by-post/play-by-chat dynamic for continuous play throughout the week.
@scoobydoo I have a feeling Google is less concerned about it than I am.
@scoobydoo Google's webmaster tools is telling me to compress the google analytics javascript hosted by google to save 13KB.
@scoobydoo Why do some people put way too much lime in Guacamole? Blegh.
Finally started watching Battlestar Galactica this weekend. Can't... stop...
Damn you domino's pizza tracker! A 10 topping limit is too low. It is not for my pizza's own good.
@clifford If you can do it on command, you should make Are you having fun yet? the trigger words.
@clifford There is always one guy who does it. Anyplace you work, there is always one guy. And it kills me :&lt;.
I'm usually pretty good at finding the silver lining on busy days like today, until I hear my biggest pet peeve Are you having fun yet?
On a business conference call and if you want to call me baby, just go ahead now randomly started playing on the line. Best call ever.
1992: I'm not going to do some little happy hour from Omaha at 12:30 Leno said.
@clifford Burn Notice is still my favorite show. Cannot wait.
@clifford Hah! I thought the premiere was alright. Monday's episode was much better.
I waited my entire childhood for Conan to take over the Tonight Show. Don't take it back.
.@clifford Stop messing with episode order in your shows. A dead character was alive in Fringe tonight. Ridiculous.
@balto I assume you meant tangy zip?
@marmaduke I was back at work :( I'm telling them I'm allergic from now on. Maybe if they think I'll die they might remember.
Jimmy Johns Don't give me mayonnaise when I say no mayonnaise. It defiles your otherwise delicious sandwiches.
@balto why is my christmas present all over your car windows?
@marmaduke I couldn't stop laughing at it. Reminded me of Boris in Snatch. We ended up using an old blanket to carry it.
@marmaduke Just put a bag over it to catch the needles. Like this?!
@marmaduke NOO! No more focaccia sandwiches and awesome gelato. :(.
@balto I hate sticker rash.
@balto Is that your belated Christmas gift to me?
@clifford Last time I used it, it jumped from cooking to delivered and we didn't actually have our pizza.
@scoobydoo Do you need a picture of Tux for reference?
@scoobydoo Pics or didn't happen.
Suffered from Phantom Cat Syndrome the whole time we were at my parents' house.
@scoobydoo it's a goddamn epidemic.
@scoobydoo I imagine the 2 and the 1 will be offset to the top left of the zeros. What did people do in the 1970's without loops?
@scoobydoo I do the same thing, and I feel like I'm competing against store owners for politeness when I buy things from them.
Our REAL pizza is here. We got 2 free sprites and they made a large instead of a medium, as if they knew this would happen. Apology accepted.
It got here, but it's not our pizza. Didn't notice until delivery guy was gone. Why do you give in to nostalgia, Kevin?
My pizza is on its way. Will let you know of future updates.
I wasn't attentive enough to the pizza tracker to livetweet my pizza status. It's already being boxed.
Watching the status of my pizza on dominos.com. I know it's weird to order domino's in Chicago but I've only had it once since college.
Finally fixed our leaky bathroom sink.
@odie We are pretty popular twitter personalities.
@odie That sounds like this is the perfect game for you:.
@scoobydoo Requisition for proper forms to submit request for clemency has been denied.
@scoobydoo pics or it didn't happen.
@clifford Another friend of mine has actually been using freemind for work for a while and always raved about it.
I swear those lines weren't there this morning!
@clifford Agreed, you should pick up DMing again.
@balto Did you at least wear a condom?
@odie I think your syllabus should just say LAMP in landscape.
@odie Except for the SQL part.
@odie Sounds more like they'd be studying to be a designer than a developer.
Got my first REAL Christmas tree today with @odie :).
@clifford And yet still one day closer to being dead!
@odie I didn't know they were leaving/had left. How'd they handle the characters leaving in the plot?
@scoobydoo omg that narwhal can talk!
@odie Are you saying some new breed of polar bees has taken over the school? You're all doomed! Dooooooooomed!
Just found this, of which I am apparently a source. I'll have to go through my tweets to remember what I contributed :P.
Best part of getting back inside my apartment: pumpkin pie in the fridge.
Got back to Chicago at 12:45AM to find a new door on our apartment. And new locks. And no new key.  @marmaduke & @santoslhalper.
@clifford Pumpkin pie for breakfast! Woo!
@balto Christmas or winter? I've had the winter, and it's quite good, like all of Bell's  stuff.
When people accidentally leave out words in emails, it makes them sound like a pirate-There be lots of dessert at the meeting!
@snoopy @balto Was the Behir's Lightning Breath supposed to be included in today's errata? My party is still dazed :P.
It's true. I am a corporate puppet.
Retweet this message to help unlock an exclusive Xbox LIVE item for Final Fantasy XIII.
@balto Then you are doing it wrong.
@balto Is it called Left Hand Imperial Stout specifically because it is for drinking with another beer in the right?
@balto Thanks. I earned that.
@hachiko JoP needs more twitter.
@marmaduke Awesome! Glad you like it, too. @odie was the only other person who I knew had heard it. I think On Directing is my favorite.
My first week as a tech lead is almost up and no one has died yet. Sooo I think it's going pretty well.
Glad I have a new Tegan & Sara album to keep me company while I have to work tonight :/.
@scrappydoo A little out of my price range. How about a javascript map? :P.
@clifford Ah, it's been a while since I've seen the original. Was the last one supposed to be a political commentary, too?
@clifford Really? Did they let you know that they were lizard people?
@odie That is probably because J. J. Abrams wasn't involved.
@odie I also don't remember them giving away the aliens were bad in the first episode.
@odie You're talking about... Universal health care?! I thought it was pretty bad. Nothing like the old one.
@odie Why does Beast look so stupid.
.@dug No, PC has custom stuff like mouse control, text chat in game, and graphics settings. You're kiddng, right? Ridiculous.
@odie That's how Ali and I spent the first 4 hours of ours, only it was the whole apartment.
Tegan, the reason you have toothpaste all over your back is because you wouldn't get out of the sink.
Tegan, the tape Ali put on the couch is to keep you from clawing it to pieces, not for you to lick the tasty tasty glue off of.
Looks like I'm not one of the lucky winners, but they'll summon me later.
Do I have jury duty? *drumroll*...
@balto I am trying to stop it, that's why I'm debugging it.
@odie I'll put it in the thread tomorrow.
@odie I'm gonna side with @balto.
@balto Honestly not sure if I want to do it or not. I could probably get out of it by telling them how spiteful I am of the court system.
Anxious for 4:30 on Thursday, when I find out if I have Jury Duty.
@balto @odie I did feel like a dork for being at a farmer's market, but there was also some spicy salsa that was awesome.
Picked up a block of spicy firehouse monterey jack cheese at the farmer's market today. I have never been this excited for cheese before.
@santoslhalper how long were you able to keep it down?
@toto i'd like a wave invite, if they're not all taken :).
@hachiko Advance Wars :D Ali's been playing a lot of Professor Layton, too.
@marmaduke sounds like you got on one of the better green-line trains.
@lassie haha, thanks :).
We already beat our 21d6 record with 35d6.
Sham, you need to roll 21d6 for damage on this guy.
Thanks for the nice tweets everyone  :).
@scrappydoo @scrappydoo Ali said yes :) we're engaged!
Happiest night of my life last night :).
Blegh, stayed late at work today. Was on time until we made a catastrophically large database change.
@marmaduke That's ok, no one ever trusts the one-armed man. It is always the one-armed man.
@balto It was a trap!
@balto I didn't even bother to look in the bag. I didn't want to know.
@marmaduke TIE-DYE IS BACK.
@balto omg, you has teh virus.
Terrible  experience today. Didn't get to play, didn't get to DM. At least got to create a mini-adventure. Still feels like a waste.
@marmaduke Oh god, just googled the OP Journal.
My credit card broke the Soupbox register. My magnetic strip must have a virus embedded in it.
today. My first 3 rolls today: 1, 20, 20.
@scrappydoo If you haven't already setup homebrew on your pre:  :P.
@scrappydoo Ugh, had no idea Imogen Heap was half of Frou Frou. On the plus side, I have 3 new albums to listen to.
@scrappydoo I wanted to yell THIS ISN'T BASKIN ROBBINS at her, but then I realized I'm still a sane person and didn't.
Lady in front of me at starbucks has never been here before, she's asking what flavors they have. If she starts asking for sample spoons...
So tempted right now.
@santoslhalper I love this weather. Totally serious.
...and we put up special fences and notices asking people not to commit suicide here. None of it worked.
@santoslhalper Haha, I hope it was the same girl from before. How have things been lately?
@balto what did you switch to?
@balto @clifford using trillian astra here.
These are the most excited goats ever.
Hooray! Eberron Campaign Guide came just in time before the weekend!
Amazing weather right now.
@marmaduke I'll be there, but Ali has to work :(.
@marmaduke Tux still eats hair. Not because he's cleaning himself, and not always his own.
Javascript map editor's finished with bulk editing and all that good stuff. Finishing up moving characters around the map before I do forums.
@marmaduke hahaha. did you tell her to learn2chicago?
@odie @marmaduke IT'S THE RAPTURE!
@lassie Not really, I miss osaka :(  Just been working a lot lately.
@clifford You could go home for lunch. Get your book, make sure guild wars is installed and up to date, etc.
@balto Been using Trillian Astra after I found out Digsby is using my computer to make them money, until I kill 3 hours configing miranda.
@balto As long as you have. How long I've worked with an offshore team is another story. The time zone difference is killer.
Starting to get sick of getting reports for bugs that need to be fixed BY the end of the day AT the end of the day.
@odie You have to be very focused to crash cars as well as I do.
sad i'm missing out on  this year.
ugh. forgot to have dinner :(.
@balto Don't worry about logging in, you let me worry about blank.
@balto are the forums almost done? there must be hundreds, thousands even, waiting to use the broken link on the site!
@balto You better be sorry for trying to give me free money.
@balto It didn't. I don't know you anymore. You embarrassed me in front of my barista. (Thanks for the email full of links though).
Drinking coffee at 2:30 in the afternoon. Still tired from this weekend.
Finished season 3 of Veronica Mars tonight and caught the 12 minutes of the season 4 pilot. Very sad that it's not still on air.
Blegh, got a flat tire coming back to town last night. Good day to work from home while it's getting fixed at least.
@balto what is the estimated distance traveled of the card?
@balto oh, THAT swillbucks. dibs. but no, they were out of gazebos.
@balto I hate swilebucks but have a fascination with dollar-associated cards. What else can you tell me about it?
Dreading driving through lollapalooza traffic to get to ohio.
@balto omg about time. i have a feeling that you're going to like.
@scrappydoo Finally tried out 1v100 last night. Wasn't bad. Sad I have to miss Gabe & Tycho as the guests next weekend.
@marmaduke hooray loophole! Are you guys at the wall tonight?
@marmaduke yeah, me too, but mostly on my pre since I can't get to the site at work.
@marmaduke mine says I have 30 left, which is mathematically impossible. Maybe mobile listening isn't counted?
@marmaduke where can I see my used hours on pandora? Is it in your iphone app? I wonder if you iphoners are the big users, I can't find mine.
@scrappydoo Awesome. One of these days I'll work up the patience to try putting OS X on mine again.
@scrappydoo Hah, you joined the netbook party? Which one did you go with?
@lassie amazon.com is the cheapest place I have seen them.
@lassie no, it's not really needed to play, but if you have a class you like, there's usually a book that adds stuff to that class.
@lassie Divine Power is one of the newest expansion books for D&D 4e. New stuff for avengers, clerics, paladins, and invokers.
After 2 full days, I finally have a working environment to test this project. I HATE Sharepoint.
omg, Divine Power just came in the mail :D New Avenger build looks pretty sweet.
finally got an invite to google voice!
I haven't tweeted in a while...
I have yet to see egg in any of my previous requests at FlatTop. Wanting to put a bowl up on the counter with only egg sticks.
Working on a javascript tile-based map editor.
@scrappydoo good, haven't managed to get OS X on it, it's nice to have for d&d (pdf book reference), or when I want to surf on the couch.
@odie Sounds like your camera has its charisma score drained.
note to self: tomorrow's meeting pick a seat that ISN'T between two guys who will be talking to each other the whole time.
@santoslhalper Haha, how was it? Edible?
@odie Slowly. People keep saying Inactivated.
@clifford I want the rest of the week off. I'm in all day meetings today and tomorrow.
@clifford Oh, and also @eddie (Blamestorming. We need to have a blamestorming session).
@clifford @odie I blame @marmaduke.
@hachiko @hachiko are at my previous client now. How awesome was your vacation?
Blocked internet: check. USB cable for unlimited Pre battery: check. System: beat.
totally forgot friday counts as holiday. Hooray surprise day off.
Castle Crashers has the coolest ending to any game ever.
Taking the day off to play Castle Crashers.
@snoopy I don't know what either of those things are, but the driver was actually very slow.
Still bright, sunny and hot in oak brook, wish some of the rain downtown would move east for no good reason.
@lassie nope, i accidentally tweeted it first, and @hachiko must have refreshed tweetdeck in the 2 seconds before i deleted it.
@clifford hah, that was me telling @lassie about mike hating 4E before trying it.
After trying throwback Mt Dew (& not really caring for it) & now going back to regular (& not really caring for it) i hate it all over again.
@marmaduke We have a surplus of chopsticks. Like a whole part of the silverware drawer dedicated to them.
I am a client ping pong ball.
1-Route all US office traffic through Dayton office 2-Tell employees to do online in-browser virtual machine training 3-??? 4-Profit?
Dear guy who was pissed at me on highway 90 for some reason and was really good at holding a grudge: I hope you got home and got over it.
Brunch is awesome. I need to start getting up for this.
I tried WoW gamer fuel mt dew.  Still don't feel like playing WoW.
First really hot summer in Chicago, and I'm out of town. (Peace out suckers :P).
Sushi Campaign was an amazing success.
Hooray, external DVD drive finally got delivered. Now I get to install OS X during our road trip this weekend.
@lassie haha. with the last day in the loop, this is serious business. srsly.
It is a dark world outside. The day star hides itself well. @hachiko and I are dedicated though. Sushi will be ours.
@hachiko You should have asked someone on the plane with a  to take that photo. Ya know, so we could see stuff  :P.
@lassie ugh, i finish up my current project tomorrow :( we were planning on going to osaka then if you're downtown.
@scoobydoo what was that ringtone site that let you cut up mp3 files into ringtones? i have a phone that doesn't suck now.
It is a lot harder to drink from a motion activated faucet than I ever would have thought.
@clifford Awesome. Publicly available character sheet means they probably wouldn't have an issue with me putting it on the sandbox.
@clifford Did you get the pdf as well? I'd love to take a look if so. At least at the character sheet.
I'm at speedway, directly across the street from speedway. Why, Ind iana, why?
@clifford Adds glasses? I want bdubs :(.
@scoobydoo I haven't used camino, but I think it's just something firefox does.
Dell mini 9 is here! If only I had an external DVD drive... anyone have one that they're willing to let me use at the office tomorrow?
Man, so much came out of the leaked webOS image today. Here's my favorite:.
@pluto How about a webOS feature to automatically turn on wi-fi if you're at a certain GPS location? :).
Trying twitpic again with my fu manchu cat.
pretty sure twitpic hates me.
wow, the  is only a tiny bit bigger than my last phone (original sanyo katana) like || that much.
Just got the OS update, major improvement on touch responsiveness already.
i didn't use any of the directions, but the GPS on sprint navigation worked pretty well on the drive home.
only gripe so far is how synergy pulls all of my contacts (including AIM screen names). can't specify certain ones, it's all or nothing.
Also, news flash guy who tried to cut in front of 20 people: standing by the register doesn't make you next when you have to take a number.
Hello from my new palm.
I have a flyer. I hope it means i get a phone.
There are about ten people behind me now.
Heard in line: If you're in an accident in a bus, you're going to win.
Everyone else in line has a blackberry or an instinct. My phone is almost embarrasing.
At the sprint store, I have friends already!
Holy crap... I'm glad this woman didn't hit the store I'm going to tomorrow.
@scoobydoo designers people at my client say that your personal site should only worry about IE 7+, and tell the rest their browser sucks.
You should probably check out all the witty things I tweeted about yesterday for  and add  to them.
I haven't tweeted yet today, and it's.
Practicing faster dice rolling since 5E went real time.
@scoobydoo no, it's better that way. it might even be a good idea to make it look worse in IE6 :P.
What is the TPK Count box for on the new DM Screen?
Some guy was trimming his fingernails next to me on the train. It was pretty gross.
I'm doing a dev i18n demo tomorrow. I hope no one remembers the demo that was given last year, since it will be the same.
Just had the hottest chicken wrap in my life. Rush hour wrap at The Rail ftw.
Had a migraine. It went away.
@santoslhalper It is Friday. I require raw fish.
ordered a dell mini 9 today, can't wait to throw OS X on it.
@balto Yes. In one of the old podcasts, someone mentioned how the DM knows they've won when PCs ask to change their alignment :P.
Just heard the White Stripes version of Tegan & Sara's Walking With a Ghost. It sounded a lot like my heart breaking.
@snoopy i need to suck it up and find a decent netbook to throw os x on  :P.
@santoslhalper link to the windows versions plz.
@santoslhalper stop bugging me and read:.
NOT at the Indy 500.
My cats are cleaning themselves. They were dirty. Now they are less dirty and wet.
I liked the intro to the random song that came on my Pandora station. I went to look at who it was. Kelly Clarkson :&lt;.
I wanted to get a steak burrito, but when the lady asked me, I told her chicken. It was good.
Waiting in line at Chipotle.
@scrappydoo I see your keyboard cat and raise you another:.
Was debating whether I should go to starbucks today. I did.
@santoslhalper I'm the jerk who fixed a bug with the RTE so people could put MORE image maps into pages. Aren't I awesome?
@hachiko it is krod mandoon trying to be serious.
@toto I liked her character, too. What little we saw, at least.
@santoslhalper I hear they have salad at salad creations today.
Design stuff didn't turn out bad today. Just need a finished logo and a better color scheme and the site will look pretty good.
Setting myself up for failure by attempting to do some design work.
Finally saw Star Trek. No longer fearful of spoilers.
@scrappydoo Ya, you'll destroy me. It'll be great. I'll play as Dan for comic relief.
Awesome, looks like Castle, Dollhouse, and Better Off Ted all got renewed for second seasons.
@clifford I can't wait to be home, and pantsless.
@clifford  is a great excuse to be as boring as possible.
@odie @santoslhalper But does it have pasta salad?
@santoslhalper Do they have caesar salad?
@santoslhalper What do they have there?
@santoslhalper What's for lunch today? Our list is bland, and we are uncaring.
@clifford what conversation? your group has its own. they are waiting for a response from you.
@clifford Yeah. It is apparent that our parties have to be forced to work together, rather than trying to actually make a storyline.
@scrappydoo Picked up street fighter IV last night. It's good, but I am not.
@clifford ugh, that sucks. you up for a game of something tonight or are you vanguarding?
Brilliant:  Glad Kanye isn't on Twitter to @ me in all caps.
@odie Enter Palm Pre Contest.
@hachiko i'm craving it for a day i will actually be at the office, like thursday.
@scrappydoo Hah, The Advantage was the first band that I got into after making a Minibosses Pandora channel.
@scrappydoo Have you heard of The Minibosses? They do a bunch of video game music covers.
@dug @rintintin 's episode will be included, yes?
Support Joss: Save Dollhouse. Fans get their voices heard @lassie  Please ReTweet and join the cause.
@scrappydoo Isn't throwback only for a limited time?
@scoobydoo even more obvious when developers make _____ designs  :P.
Once he figures out how to retract them, next step: Embedding them into his fists.
@scrappydoo Here's that D&D webcomic I mentioned  (the server is crazy slow on new comic days).
Awesome.  Found the google code repository for the reCAPTCHA ASP.NET library and added in the lang property. Finished with 1 min to spare.
@scrappydoo I never even thought about that.  Is it one-to-one, or are the subtitles actually somewhat eloquent?
@scrappydoo Has to be Pikey.
Are you kidding me? reCAPTCHA's ASP.NET library doesn't let me access the lang attribute to change the language. WTF reCAPTCHA?!
Wow.  was awesome tonight.  Please don't get canceled!
Sweet, 40% off of one book at Borders for borders rewards members.
Busy morning. Demo went well.  Rewarded with sushi and friends.
@scoobydoo don't encourage her  :P.
@santoslhalper I can't believe I wasn't invited to the decision-making party.
@santoslhalper looks like chris doesn't want to go there. 2 against 1.
One of our cats, Tux, drools if you pet him a lot.
@santoslhalper apparently twitter doesn't send your password to you when you sign up. want the one i signed chris up with?  :P.
@hachiko It's about time you saw the light.
@hachiko is using his english degree to write programs to do algebraic equations.
Was wearing an old shirt yesterday that was baggier than I remembered, then i remembered that was a style (sort of).
Because half of the things I think of in a day cause me to remember particular penny arcade strips, I'm going to tweet the strip & the cause.
Listening to techno/trance so I don't start singing randomly today.
Sweet, now we can watch the swine flu zombie outbreak LIVE.
@santoslhalper Agreed, but @clifford is also already taken, sadly, by a fictional character.
@santoslhalper ugh, cspags is already taken.  and they have NEVER updated. this is killing our 'force chris to join twitter' plan.
The chicago fire roll at the sushi house clears my sinuses.
@santoslhalper so you convinced chris to join twitter, right?
Pandora has tricked me into starting to sing a song at my cubicle twice today.  Damn you! *shakes fist*.
@hachiko You made yourself a liar. AGAIN, you double liar.
The place we went for breakfast had  pancakes! Sadly, I wasn't brave enough to try them.
help fix the internet:.
@hachiko I can't believe you would drink on a school night.
@hachiko omg you tweeted more than once, you liar. hope everything goes alright.
One lane highway construction sucks. Hooray google maps.
@hachiko Your game came today.  I think USPS hates you  :(.
@hachiko Welcome to Twitter!
@clifford I slappa da bayse!
@hachiko That was only one solution that built, I still have the public solution, which is what really matters, and isn't building now.
@hachiko Build Succeeded. Pwnt.
@scrappydoo tell webpass to expand to chicago :P.
Detective work today. Trying to figure out what the people before me were doing with these remote machines.
My train stopped about 50 yards away from my stop because of equipment failure. Ugh.
sweet, my order of the stick board game shipped today  :).
@clifford I have a feeling I will get some nsfw results if I type that into google.
@clifford Pronunciation doesn't matter if you're not speaking :P.
@clifford Is it dunkin donuts? that's what I've got at the office.
@clifford mike's texting so i'm tweeting. So this is what this feels like.
We got a roomba today. His name is Broomy.
Blarg, stuck around at the office to fix a bug and now i'm hitting all the traffic on the way home.
The drummer is good, the frontman looks like Austin Powers.
Watching My My My now... Pretty sure this guy's keyboard is on the 'toy piano' setting.
Waiting for people to show up to see the band Arma.
Out of work early on a friday. Woo!
I don't like you, activia yogurt.  Regulating my digestive system should not mean making me not go to the bathroom.
@hachiko omg you never tweet anymore.
@clifford are you gonna get the cylon detector app for your iPod touch?
@clifford i'm twittering just to show tegan off.
I've got most of the stuff for RPGSandbox ready. Still a few things to streamline, but if I don't start testing now, I never will.
Going rock climbing at the gym.
One more thing to make a bit more efficient before I'm ready to start live testing RPGSandbox.
Seeing if my new phone plan has kicked in yet.
@clifford I feel obligated to stop following you now  :P.
@clifford first or second? and did you not finish them?
@clifford you would have to learn ruby (and rails).
@clifford do you want me to ship you some? fedex overnight? overhour?
Also loved that Sony's implying that Microsoft is taking away constitutional rights by charging for live.
Who would predict a PS3 without a blu-ray drive? The games are ON BLU-RAY DISCS.
Finally found a small lightbox solution that works for me:.
Close to having a usable version of RPGSandbox, hope to deploy sometime next week.
We already have a solution to this!
So the D&D webapp is coming along.  Having some memory issues with one of the pages, need to reduce the database calls.
I ordered a pocket knife from an online craftsman shop. Now I get e-mails about how I can SAVE BIG! on axes.
c'mon, DHL. bring me my 360!
Writing a D&D webapp. 3.5 first, 4E once I get to play.
Wearing my half-life 2 shirt today, lot of comments on it. Kind of funny that everyone recognizes it so easily now.
Hello from my iPod touch :).
Work lunch at cosi.
creating a twitter account.
bracketing out the best star trek episode is definitely one of three coolest things I did this week.
laying awake at night thinking about kirby air ride two.
@rintintin was really hoping it was going to be uber for actual benches.
@santoslhalper @scrappydoo I guess I'll have to keep looking for my special someone with a bad case of osteoporosis.
@santoslhalper @scrappydoo I'm still a software developer seeking retired astronaut.
snuck my tinder bio into one of my favorite podcasts. can no longer say online dating has been wholly unsuccessful.

Living in a post Top Chef America...
@pluto @dug I searched Gwon on periscope and then realized that might not work.
@pluto I wish I knew how periscope worked so I could have this.

Everyone just won money for trying to fuck each other.@clifford @scoobydoo.
Testing. Testing. 1 2 3.
I am the the Christmas unicorn.
@scrappydoo @eddie Sometimes you just have to be.
Dick fingers. @scrappydoo @toto @rintintin @snoopy.
Don't cut your foreskin.
@santoslhalper my favorite band is Dubstep.
Like that guy Ponzi, I wanna have a scheme named after me.
How many of you have used your dicks to play World of Warcraft?
Life is like a box of wine.
I need a handle of my own to drink while playing video games.
You didn't spell it right. There's definitely no i in shit. Oops.
I have the hobbit on casette. I used to go to bed listening to that shit.
I almost burped but then it got stuck in my throat and now I'm disappointed.
How did he spell come? This is important.  Right. Like the wright brothers.
I dressed up as an elf for Christmas. You'd be proud.
New idea: liquid meat you can drink.
This is the weirdest handholding circle that didn't end in amen.
@balto I don't know what this is, or how twitter works, but I approve.
@lassie no i have no talents.
I hope the iPhone SE will push other vendors to make smaller phones. My tiny sausage fingers cannot reach across these massive phone screens.
@hachiko I CAN EAT MY DINNER IN A FANCY RESTAURANT.
@toto You're not the first to want it—take a look at this:.
...the placebo effect, though a real phenomenon, seems to be quite small.
@snoopy Glad it could help!
I envy anyone who can get WebPack to work.
Yesterday someone said JavaScript is everywhere! to which I responded haters are everywhere.
@marmaduke Aw, thanks! Hope they can help.
I am debugging the coolest bug I have ever debugged.
@hachiko is No Man's Sky only for PS4 still.

I finally did it. I beat Neko Atsume.
Cops are asking  and 23andMe for their customers' DNA.
@lassie I don't agree with your position on iPhone encryption. I feel that you should not build back doors into communication systems.
Apple: the Backdoor the FBI Wants Would Work on All iPhones.
Euphoria is a chat system with threads. Imagine chat + Reddit.
@clifford it's even worse than that.
@santoslhalper  has the old apple earphones for like $15 which i buy, wear out after ~1 year, repeat.
@scrappydoo goodness, I'm plotzing.
@santoslhalper thank you so much for @scoobydoo. I cannot stop laughing.
@odie I tried to make them stand alone.
@rintintin Sure! I'll dig around to see if I can get a discounted copy (usually up to my publisher, not me).
@rintintin The book should be all ready to go as is. When the book is finally published, very little of the text will change (if any).
@rintintin Soon! There's been a bit of a holdup, but you can get the 99%-finished ebook at.
Cannot wait for the next season of @eddie, if it ever happens.
@hachiko Neko Atsume is the best video game that has ever been created.
@snoopy Hope it's a good paradigm shift! Sometimes that happens to me and I feel a sense of doom; so much I've done has been incorrect.
@snoopy Glad it could help! Let me know if you run into any issues.
@balto I've had similar struggles with iOS Chrome. Glad to know I'm not the only one!
@toto Thanks for having me! Feel free to have anyone reach out if they have questions.
@lassie Looks like 2008 to me.
@scrappydoo @marmaduke @pluto Thanks for having me!
@santoslhalper how dare they dis Avril.
Just published Expecting.js, an actively-maintained fork of the great Expect.js.

@pluto Yes! Helmet is more for Express than @scrappydoo, but it does protect your head.
@santoslhalper Hope my posting on HN didn't cause too much trouble! Had no idea it'd be so popular.
@santoslhalper I really liked the Running Costs page on Cushion so I posted it on HN and now you're having to defend your decisions! Sorry.
@rintintin Not just you.
A post about a JavaScript URL parsing trick I learned at @odie.

@clifford I can't fav twice.
Just played Rivals of Aether for the first time—super fun.
@snoopy I (1) have never been to the place (2) love the band (3) really enjoy @hachiko and thank you very much for the show.
Dream of a book about Express.js written by me…now imagine it 50% off today w/ code dotd010116au…your dream is real.

@santoslhalper I'd definitely be interested in working on such a module. Helmet has limited its scope to HTTP headers only, though.

@rintintin Do you recommend any charities that help women's rights (in tech or not)?
@toto If you need more, I'm working on a longer book about Express. If you've any interest, let me know! I can get you a discount.
@santoslhalper Let me know what you think of the book!
@toto Hope it could help!
@scrappydoo In short: basically all of the middleware.
Just wrote a little letter to the @lassie about net neutrality; I'd encourage my fellow Americans to do so too.
@marmaduke @dug Thanks! Hope it can help.
Just published Helmet v0.3.0, a Node.js security helper. Lots of cleanup and much better docs. Enjoy!
Pretty disappointed by these bitcoin jokes.

Sometimes I like to imagine if Drake were super good at Super Smash Bros.
@dug Thanks! Hope it could help.
I had a bunch of songs queued for listening and I skipped them all to listen to Bossy by Kelis.
How long has Pikaday.js been around?? I have hated every date picker on the entire internet before this day.

That little shout-out at the end didn't seem like something Jobs would've done.
GeoGuessr is my favorite use of the Google Maps API. It drops you at a random street view, you have to guess where.
@balto Drake is an emotion.
This dubstep remix of the Banjo-Kazooie theme is WEAK.
Now that Express doesn't use Connect, does anyone use Connect by itself any more?
@scoobydoo Does this interest you?
@scoobydoo Getting this (302 redirects) from both Firefox and Chrome….
@marmaduke dog I live here.
@santoslhalper if there were no hotties would you feel the same.
@lassie Aw, thanks! I'm actually working on a book about Express. It'll be coming out later this year and I can let you know...

Disappointed that my phone has stopped autocorrecting to pirates when I type pilates.

It’s Time to Take Mesh Networks Seriously.
@hachiko glad to see that Wu Tang ain't nothing to fuck with in terms of vocabulary.
Congrats to my friends graduating today!
We call our roads and bridges and water and sewer pipe networks public infrastructure … what about the Internet?
@odie Would love to donate bitcoin to @rintintin. Is such an option available?
*man yells nonsense out his window*Narrator: Don't you wish there were a better way?
@clifford It's Ruby-specific but.
@clifford I had a nerdgasm when I saw those prosthetics.
@pluto There's a typo on the sign up screen (should be don't). Just FYI!
@scoobydoo I agree 100% with your review of my book!
@dug I see you're (1) into Vim (2) into Angular and Go (3) in Ann Arbor. We should meet up next week.
I just overheard a woman sigh, and after a pause, whisper the World Wide Web.
How Police Spied on a Whole City.
@marmaduke Sadly, no—I'm still on a student budget. I was just curious if you'd any experience as a bitcoin merchant.
@marmaduke I saw that you accept bitcoin—what's that been like?
May we all play a little Game Boy today.
Unabashedly blaring music from old Nintendo 64 games.
@clifford these are the twitter equivalent of ancient aztec gold.

Which celebrity name is nerdier: Vim Diesel or John C++ Reilly.
@scrappydoo Spam, I think.
How can I become @balto.
@scoobydoo I suspect they know that they're on their way out.

@snoopy Would love to donate bitcoin to @eddie — any way I can make that happen?
@scrappydoo Thanks for the Ruby gem tutorial!
Just published a CLI interface for @scoobydoo!
Surprised that physicists believe in true randomness.
What bitcoin needs to do to improve its brand:.
@dug I see. I've been looking to play around with a new language and Rust was a candidate.
@dug Are you a fan of Rust?
@balto No problem! Glad it could help.
@marmaduke Does Realtime Weekly have an RSS feed?
@marmaduke Isn't that what responsive means?
@lassie Whatever, I believe. Not a joke.
@dug Thrilled to help.
@scoobydoo Thanks! Glad you liked it. And now you know more about hippo milk than ever before.
Just making some pretty great commits.
Petition to change the word callback to hollaback.

I'm not optimistic about Bitmessage's success.
@odie Thanks for the Vim article—really helpful! I'm gonna go change some stuff now….
Why isn't @toto called Vim-im.
@rintintin @eddie Fantastic site! Very well done.
@hachiko Thanks! It seems like it's mostly changing your bundled middleware. There are a bunch of guides online I've seen, too.
omg, Node Weekly featured my article. Very cool.
@scoobydoo Maybe. I don't know that I can call myself a Git expert, though.
There are a million Git for SVN people guides but no SVN for Git people guides.
This looks cool: easily send messages to GitHub users with their public keys.
@santoslhalper I own one.
Delaware's Child Online Protection Act.
@odie Indeed it does.
@pluto I'd mostly like to make sure people stay secure. What do you think is the best way to do that?
@clifford Just saw your 2FA site. I've made one myself and yours is better than mine; any way we could merge to avoid user confusion?
@hachiko ah, okay. Let me know if you have more issues!
@hachiko What's difficult about it? I might be able to help.
@pluto How would you improve it? It's long overdue for a visual upgrade.
@marmaduke I'm getting 404s on every one of your site's pages, FYI.
@odie I'm just sayin that you don't know.
@odie WOAH WOAH WOAH. I have two cats and a dog and LET ME TELL YOU that they can all be nice.
@odie Exactly two years ago, you pade a pun: Thank Evan For That. You then said that I'd feel nostalgic. You were right.
@scoobydoo I have one invite left. Send me your email and I'll invite you!
Why I am I the only one who calls the Ruby programming language the ol' rubes.
@rintintin It seems like Go is mostly used for servers. I'd love to see it take on UIs and embedded stuff, but maybe that's not gonna happen.
Have people used  to build non-commandline client software?
Dogecoin used for good.
f.lux has a really cool update.
@scoobydoo THIS COULD BE YOUR LIFE IF YOU DON'T GET MOTIVATTTEEDDDDD.
Just preordered @toto's new album! Excited.
@santoslhalper you have an unfair advantage.
@dug No problem! Enjoy.
@snoopy Just got my @eddie and I'm curious about that too.
Wanted: @scrappydoo code completion support in @lassie.
@dug Still need an Atom invite?

@snoopy Thanks for sharing my list! Hope it helps.
@pluto Thanks for sharing the site! Hope it helps.
@scoobydoo Agreed! If you see anything to add, I'd love a contribution.
@dug Thanks! Glad you liked it.
All this meshnet stuff looks really cool but hard to get into without a friend nearby. I'd love to play around with it.
@lassie What's your email? (If you don't want to send it on public Twitter, you can DM me).
@lassie Not sure, but I have 2 invites left if you need one.
@toto I've got 2 Atom invites…still need one?
Anyone figured out a good way of putting @lassie packages into a dotfiles repo? I'd rather not check in the whole package….
@odie Thanks! Glad you like it.
The @clifford looks pretty cool.
Let me teach you how to publish your first package to @rintintin.
@balto YouTube, but only for awhile. Writely, Siri, and Android also did well in my opinion.
Just signed a petition to support net neutrality.
@rintintin Your site appears to be down, giving an Error establishing a database connection error.
@scrappydoo Thanks a ton! I'll take a look at these.
@scrappydoo Love your JS1k demo. Have you found a tutorial online for raymarching? I'd love to learn it.
@scrappydoo Are you trying to include a custom font? If so, you can just reference the font as long as it's installed on your system.
I love that this is a real Unicode character.
Just published my first @lassie package. Ironically, it's VimL syntax highlighting.
@eddie I like that it's customizable and has dotfiles. That's big for me.
@marmaduke It looks like it'll be open source after the beta.
@eddie Both look very interesting to me. I'm excited for both.
@hachiko Doesn't it slow JavaScript down a lot?
@hachiko Thanks! I'd love to know your feedback.
@odie Not a bad comparison.
@toto it's invite-only for now.
I think the @lassie is just another example of the JavaScript takeover of Earth.
@scoobydoo …can't decide if trolling….
@dug I'd be careful about disabling CSP—it can make you vulnerable to some kinds of attacks.
@eddie  on Freenode is hoppin'.
@toto There was some confusion, but maybe it was just my confusion. It'll be open-sourced after beta.
@balto It's OSX 10.8+ for now, sadly.
@rintintin Update: it'll be open-source after beta.
@pluto Looks like  will be open-sourced after beta.
@toto It's unclear whether it's going to be open source at this point.
@pluto It's unclear whether @lassie will be open source in the future…hoping so.
@snoopy CSON is CoffeeScript Object Notation (the CoffeeScript variant of JSON).
@lassie Hit me up with your email and I'll invite you bby.
@eddie @lassie Does Mike need an invite?
@eddie Still need an Atom invite?
@scrappydoo  on freenode is hoppin'.
@rintintin Neovim is the only thing I've seen recently that's close.
@rintintin I see what you mean….
@rintintin What does the icon look like now?
@rintintin From hanging out on the IRC, it seems like it's not open during beta but will be OSS later.
@clifford That's what I think.  and other things like it (with things like node-webkit) seem like the future.
GitHub's new @lassie looks SWEET.
@marmaduke I'd love to play with it if your invites haven't dried up already!
Finished all of the IT Crowd yesterday. Excellent show (except for the pilot).
Just found out about the view command, which is like opening Vim in read-only mode. Occasionally quite useful!
Bummed that @santoslhalper is done with Bowser, their WebRTC-enabled browser for iOS. Hope they'll open-source it.
@marmaduke haha, thank you!
@lassie I see. Good plan!
@lassie For what reason?
This might be the funniest Wikipedia page. Thanks @toto.
@eddie You're not the only one! I usually have a client and server folder.
I love JSHint, but sometimes you want to disable it completely for a file. Here's how:.
Excited to see where Neovim goes. It's a modern reboot of Vim.
@clifford I'd love to have Karma in Ann Arbor, MI.
I like the Node nop module—a function that does nothing.
Petition: Don't Sell Out The People Of Oakland To The Department Of Homeland Security.
Just made a Node library for parsing robots.txt files. Take a look at cyborg.txt version 0.1.0!
Time to jailbreak Chrome?
@snoopy @pluto It'd be interesting to see population density superimposed on this.
@odie Could I get reimbursed for travel from Ann Arbor? I assume not, but I might go if I can.
@hachiko that's the double-edged sword of Express. Have you tried adding controllers of any sort?
@santoslhalper (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
Just added a bunch of domain registrars to my two-factor authentication list! Stay safe on them internets.
BREAKING: Facebook Burns Money.
@hachiko enhance in what way?
I'm taking an exam in a room where we're all seated around one large table. This is weird.
Article about people who opposed the NSA and how they were ignored.
@toto Thanks for sharing! Keep me updated about your security repo.
@scrappydoo What are you trying to do?
@santoslhalper you haven't asked me for that dolla yet.
Just donated to my two favorite podcasts, @rintintin and @santoslhalper!
These beats are dope.
Very cool XKCD about frequency.
@scrappydoo The former, although I always find ternary operators more difficult to read than if statements.
@hachiko Node is always touted as more performant than others because it's event-driven. I'd say both are relatively secure.
@hachiko I've used both, but Express a bit more.
I'm sure there's a good reason there isn't a nice ISP startup. Is it regulatory? Is the infrastructure too expensive?
Wanted: an ISP that's not terrible.
Just read the words classical inheritance in a non-programming article for the first time.
@odie Glad you liked it! Hope it helps.
Wow, Gulp is easier than Grunt by a mile.
I've recently been using @scoobydoo integration in Vim and it has made me MUCH faster with them JavaScripts because I make lots of mistakes.
@hachiko that's pretty LEET if you ask me.
My @rintintin shirt came! Very cool.
alias very=gitalias wow=‘git status’ $ wow$ such commit$ very push.
Are you tryna tell me that @rintintin has food trucks.
@santoslhalper I'm thinking about playing around with it. it looks trill.
@santoslhalper was project m hard to install?
@marmaduke Yup! Thanks for hosting my site and for supporting.
@eddie There's a link error in your tweet (lhttp instead of.
Just added Ally Bank to my two-factor authentication list (thanks @balto)! Keep your accounts secure.
Today I learned that there's an obscure chess piece called the Nightrider.
This JSON programming language seems kinda cool.
@lassie I think of it more as Connect for ECMAScript 6, not Express.
@clifford I'd suspect (1) people don't know about it (2) people don't understand why it's important.
@pluto Thanks for sharing my  list!
@clifford I made a list of sites that support two-factor authentication, which might help your hacked friends!
@dug I started during the first public beta. I didn't use it as my main browser until they added extensions.
@snoopy That's how I feel too.
@snoopy Technologically and socially interesting. Not sure it's 100% the future, but a very cool idea.
@snoopy A little, yeah.
Just updated HumanizeDuration.js to version 0.6.0 with German support!
@hachiko what if PoZ did this.
I'll be participating in  in a few days. You should too!
@scrappydoo Glad you liked it!
@toto I think that can be said about me for all types of reading.
@toto I've only read one comic and it was Scott Pilgrim. I'm not sure if I liked the Scott Pilgrim part or the comic part.
@toto I don't know a thing about Marvel but I've heard about this API.
@toto That's the price you pay for (some) security. But I agree that it's too much—this is why SPDY seems cool.
Inbox zero feels so good.
@balto I'd love to hear about your experience. Express seemed more intuitive to me but Hapi intrigued me.
@dug It's gotta be Melee.
@santoslhalper Anything I can do to help with this effort?
@odie Thanks for sharing my site! Hope it helped.
@rintintin Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it helps.
@hachiko I've thought about adding something like that to my 2-factor authentication list. Does that interest you?
@eddie this game tight as heck.
@toto I use IFTTT to funnel many RSS feeds into Pocket.
@snoopy Glad you think it's cool cool cool. Hope it helped!
Mmmmm yeah those exactly-140-character tweets mmm.
@toto Thanks, Phil! @scoobydoo, I take some comfort in that banks have an even better security measure in place: the law. But still bad!
What is the worst app.
@eddie Haha, love the picture. Thanks for sharing!
They did it. They made a pot-related cryptocurrency.
I didn't make this but apparently I love anime.
Vim will be my Valentine.
@clifford Works again — seems like the moment I decide to tell you, it starts working again! Thanks for the site.
@clifford I've been unable to reach microjs dot com for awhile now. Is it broken?
Just updated HumanizeDuration.js with Norwegian language support (with some help)!
@lassie It means more for Node, which will have ECMAScript 6 pretty soon.
Aw, @marmaduke has no plan to support new JavaScript features like yield.
Can't decide if I should feel embarrassed when I log into GameFAQs.
@pluto Thanks! Glad you liked it.
Ann Arbor has gotta stop being so cold.
@lassie Perhaps the fact that Mongo has more users (and therefore more support + community), but that's all I can think of.
There is a religion about filesharing.
The Grand C++ Error Explosion Competition.
@scrappydoo I wrote a tutorial about  that MIGHT help with some of your confusion….
@pluto same for mine, which is why I quit.
@marmaduke My gut feeling says yes, it's a bad idea but I can't give you a concrete reason why...
This new @snoopy album is p excellent.
@toto This tutorial might be of some use:.
Just voted in the .GIFYS.
@santoslhalper no i dont care idk why.
@santoslhalper that was my wifi. No jokes.
@snoopy I use @lassie.
Brilliant: the South Korean government wants you to be able to delete crapware bundled with your phone.
@rintintin Two-factor authentication is on a number of other websites, too.
Best wifi network names.
@balto I've thought about reading it. You'd recommend it?
About to see a short @dug talk! Excited.
This Walgreens is not ashamed of its love for Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
@lassie Hope you liked it!
@eddie Thanks for sharing!
@scoobydoo I think it's DEFINITELY worth it for your email (I can forgot password if I'm in your email), and I use it elsewhere too.
@hachiko I registered  at.
@eddie dinner line is endless.
Turning up in the @odie.
@clifford When y'all figure out transportation details, could you let me know?
My @eddie breakfast of champions: popcorn eaten out of a coffee filter.
@hachiko where might I find a sleeping area?
Pivot your startup into a criminal organization.
Leaving for @eddie soon!
@eddie will there be showers or will I be filthy this weekend.
There is a World Rock Paper Scissors Society.
Today I learned that there is a maximum weight for jail.
@pluto Thanks for sharing! I love Majora's Mask.
console.loge: such console. so loge. wow.
Google won't break into your home. You'll invite them in.  via @scrappydoo.
Chrome 32 just broke my getUserMedia. Happening to anyone else?
@balto Thanks! Super helpful while it's down.
@scoobydoo This is the 3rd time it's happened in a few months. Annoying stuff.
npm, please, I beg of you.
@clifford Same for me.
@marmaduke I've been working on a list of sites supporting two-factor auth. They might help in the cold winter!
@pluto @marmaduke Alright. Good to know!
@marmaduke have y'all done NLP stuff with JavaScript? …and have you done it with Korean?
Just completely emptied my @santoslhalper reading list. I don't think it's been empty for years.
NSA compared to Stasi. Damn.
@dug It's to block the other XSS —.
@toto Express seems quicker to learn but it does much less for you. I think both are good choices, but I'm no expert.
@lassie I see. It's a price I'm willing to pay, I guess!
@dug Thanks for sharing my list! Hope it helps some people.
@lassie Why? It's certainly less convenient, but it's a lot safer (I feel).
@odie Agreed! I've made a list of sites that support two-factor authentication, if it helps!
It's so cold in the D.
@eddie Click Clock Wood. No doubt.
@scoobydoo Using a VERY long password makes it nearly impossible to brute-force.
@snoopy hmmmm...I'll keep an eye on this.
@marmaduke This looks really cool. Is it web-based?
Improving my blog's security on the heels of @scoobydoo's blog hackery.
@hachiko What have you found? I'd love to learn more about those solutions.
@balto Mincer is a lot like Sprockets from Rails, but I had more luck with Grunt.
@odie It's also worth adding two-factor auth to other sites too. I made a little list, if you'd like!
@scoobydoo It'd be tough, I think. It's not the end-all-be-all of security, though.
@pluto Agreed! I made a little list of sites that support two-factor auth if you'd like.
@scrappydoo I made a list of sites with two-factor authentication; perhaps it'll help new year's resolutions!
I just went on Steam and searched video games.
Is there a list of current/upcoming hackathons and programming contests?
I don't use analytics on my website because I block analytics on the web when I can (thanks @toto).
@scoobydoo Great to see that your app is Express-powered, but you might want to app.disable('x-powered-by') to keep hackers out.
Just played Proteus by @eddie and @snoopy. A sublime, surreal, and recommendable experience.
@santoslhalper I'm a web developer who loves your videos. I'd love to help with SRL if I can! Let me know!
Is there a website that shows bitcoin's legality by country?
@lassie Thanks! I think I'm gonna jump ship with my next laptop.
@lassie Just read your great article about switching away from Mac. Are you happy with the Dell you bought? How's the trackpad?
@rintintin I'd love to find a good open-source/not evil alternative….
Does anyone know what the X-iinfo HTTP header is?
@dug I see what MIGHT be a security vulnerability on Cryptsy — can I DM/email the issue to you?
@scrappydoo It's much harder for someone to hack into your account; they'll need your phone's texts to log in. Not immune, but safer.
@odie Unfortunately, it's fairly easy to fake what browser you're on, and very hard to detect this is my phone.
@snoopy For how much? I might sell mine.
@pluto Thanks! Hope it helps.
@rintintin Can I try it with yours when I get back?
@rintintin those tags are incredible. Would they work with my phone?
@hachiko Talk To Me In Korean is a great site for learning Korean. Maybe worth adding?
@rintintin let me know when your post is up!
@toto Personally a big fan of Jade.
Cool that @clifford's corporate expense account is, itself, a Venmo account.
@dug Ah, I agree with that completely!
@dug I think it depends on the site, but I generally agree.
@scoobydoo I think they do!
@eddie Hope you liked it!
@toto That happened to me yesterday. It was super annoying.
@santoslhalper really? That sounds dreadful.
Add this to the list of things to hate about US-based mobile carriers.
Entrepreneurs need to be solving real problems. A great read.
@dug I'm making a list of sites that support  which might help your readers.
@lassie Story of my life ;).
@lassie I'm surprised it's so difficult. Good luck!
@lassie SASS is originally written in Ruby, so I'd imagine its JavaScript port is flaky. Works like a charm in Ruby environments.
@lassie I don't much like Grunt but I use it begrudgingly. I got it working with Jade if you need help.
@marmaduke No problem! Hope it helps.
@marmaduke If it helps, I wrote a guide called Understanding Express that might explain some things.
@marmaduke Agreed  it's a lot more like Ruby's Sinatra.
@hachiko Good luck on your job interview tomorrow!
@lassie Not sure if this helps, but you can put them in your package.json's scripts.
@marmaduke Glad you like it! Hope it helps.
I still cannot believe Dogecoin is real and that I have a non-zero amount.
Just mistyped my name as Evan Haha.
@rintintin Stumbled upon a videogame-related API….
@scrappydoo Yup jasmine-node lets one run Jasmine tests from the command line.
@rintintin You might be able to do something that gathers the data as it comes in — the graph gets more interesting as time goes on. Maybe?
@rintintin A few ideas: bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies), tweets-per-minute, GitHub, subreddit data.
@scrappydoo Is QUnit not standalone? I thought it was but I've never used it.
@santoslhalper Thanks a ton! Anything else you'd like me to write about? Mocha, Passport, and WebRTC are on my list….
@pluto Thanks for sharing my  site! Hope it helps :).
Only one exam left before the end of my semester!
@scrappydoo Turns out that Jasmine has been number 1 for awhile now (for at least two years)! I was surprised too.
@scoobydoo damn I still love this logo.
@dug Thanks! Welcome to the list.
Thanks to a lot of help, I've added a ton of new sites to my two-factor authentication list!
@eddie thanks for sharing! Hope it helps.
@hachiko Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it helps.
@rintintin Thanks! Let me know if you see any sites I should add.
@rintintin Thanks for spreading the word about 2-factor auth. I'm making a list of  services which might help!
@odie Thanks for sharing my  list! Hope it can help some folks.
@pluto I'm working on a list of sites that support two-factor auth, which might be useful. Sorry you got hacked!
@lassie I've been making a larger list of sites that support two-factor auth. Perhaps you'll find it useful?
@toto Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps :).
@balto I'd love to add GoDaddy to my list of sites supporting two-factor authentication.  Any links I can put?
@scoobydoo Thanks for sharing! Hope it helps!
@clifford MY SECRET LAIR!
@clifford Thanks for the mention of my two-factor authentication list on Security Now!
@lassie The @toto JavaScript Developer Survey shows that people like @balto, Mocha, and @snoopy.
@santoslhalper I wrote a short guide about understanding Express if you'd like help learning it. Hope it helps!
@marmaduke SuperTest is fantastic. Do you use Mocha with that, or something else?
@scrappydoo This is great!
@eddie It actually worked -false alarm!
Gonna start a delicious website called SnackOverflow.
It's all fun and games until you have to parse XML.
@hachiko @dug You'd probably ignore things like of and the, and then you could manually exclude things like proper nouns.
@hachiko @dug What would you want highlighted? What kind of control would you, as a writer, want?
@santoslhalper Doesn't seem like it to me, but it's certainly not as big as vanilla JS.
@dug @hachiko What do you folks think of the English syntax highlighter?
@odie Hope it helps!
@scoobydoo Hope my list helps! Thanks for sharing it.
@pluto Thanks for sharing my two-factor authentication list! Hope it helps :).
@scoobydoo Thanks for sharing my link! Hope it helps.
@scrappydoo Thanks for linking to my list in your Lifehacker article!
@odie That's so cool! Thanks for letting me know.
@clifford Any chance Venmo wants to support two-factor authentication for better security?
President Obama calls on every American to learn to code. Woah.
It is time for the world's governments to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance.
GitHub and StackOverflow visualized as cities.
@santoslhalper Let me know! I'd love to use it.
@santoslhalper Is Bounty for Code dead? I like the idea a lot.
Blog post: the Underhanded C Contest.
@pluto Agreed. I'm building a list of sites that support two-factor authentication – would you like to help?
@balto Are any of the places you've used 2-factor auth NOT on this list? I'm trying to build a compendium.
@pluto You can also enable two-factor authentication in lots of other places, which I'd recommend:.
@clifford Of course! Any help is welcome.
@marmaduke Made a list of sites that support two-factor auth. Any way I could promote it to help others?
@snoopy Thought you might want to add some more sites to @dug's 2-factor auth articles:.
Want a list of every place that you can enable two-factor authentication?
Just donated to @lassie for.
Bitcoin's biggest weakness, as I see it, is that it's largely being used in speculation and not real transactions. (Altcoins even more so.).
@rintintin I've less than 1 BTC, but yeah. I also think it's very interesting. Interested to see where it goes.
@rintintin are you into bitcoin?
@eddie Very true. I suppose the word seems in my tweet helps.
It seems that we now know the identity of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
Glad we didn't get embarrassed.
@toto Does Hola work by using a proxy, or by some other method?
@hachiko I see. Yeah, I wish there was a way to say this function returns undefined, perhaps with a different -&gt; syntax.
Practicing my Spanish on @hachiko's new Android app. Really slick.
Damn I have a lot of unread messages from ladies.
@hachiko I usually just ignore the return values in CoffeeScript in cases like that -why do you care what it returns?
@hachiko You might be able to do `el.addEventListener 'click', @marmaduke.bind(this)`, but that's the best I can think of.
Just donated a little bit of money to npm!
@hachiko There must be a more elegant way to do that, but I admit I can't think of one.
I like the idea of live coding mentioned in this article.
@snoopy It's settled, then!
Finally started playing with Browserify...it is amazing.
Is there any reason to use Underscore.js instead of Lodash.js?
@scrappydoo Bitcoin would be awesome to have on Newegg!
@clifford I don't know of one. Maybe I should hunt for some NLP libraries.
@clifford I thought it'd be cool to highlight based on part of speech, but that seems computationally taxing.
@clifford What are your thoughts on the idea?
@santoslhalper My name is also Evan Hahn and I'm also a developer. Is there a rule that says that we must fight?
@scoobydoo Glad you liked it! Hope it helped.
An experiment: syntax highlighting for English. Scroll a bit to see what it looks like. Would love your thoughts.
Vim completely obliterates fiction.
Anyone have an invite to Lobsters?
I do not remember writing this code but I am glad I did.

Just used mkfifo. I am a real Linux neckbeard now.
The Battle for Power on the Internet.
Eating Korean barbecue for breakfast.
@lassie Haha, no -this site stole some of MY content and I found some of yours stolen as well. I wanted to let you know!
@odie Found one of your @dug articles plagiarized here. Just FYI!
@lassie Recently found some of your content copy-pasted on this site. FYI!
My shuffle needs to STEP UP ITS GAME.
Brosing the wob with Gogle Chrom.
@balto Found your Understanding MVC And MVP copy-pasted on a sketchy website -just FYI!
To me, the most striking thing about the NSA scandal is how it's changed my behavior online. I double-check my private messages.
@scoobydoo I think you might like Oh Land.
@pluto FYI: found one of your Gigaom articles on a site called OwnTutorials, which has 100% stolen content.
What is this hubbub about Java Script running on the Inter Net.
I can eat 100% of any pizza.
@eddie who are you.
What organizations are trying to increase internet access around the globe?
Google Apps drops support for IE9. Brave.
@rintintin Seems like it -it's been flaky for me today.
@lassie Not just you -it's flaky for me too.
I don't know anything about anime, but Youmacon was super cool.
Great answer to what's the hardest bug you've debugged?
The end is nigh.
@marmaduke I like to think of myself as a hero.
All I want is unlimited pizza.
@scoobydoo I am NOT your friend.
@rintintin Glad it could help!
Was surprised to learn that CSS injection is a real problem.
@hachiko send me screens.
Second day in a row that there's a milk-carrying man on the bus. This is a different guy and has two gallons. Is this a conspiracy.
@snoopy It's been sorta put on hold -I've been busy with classes. I want to get back to it when I have more time!
@toto I also love software updates. I updated immediately even though I had things to do.
@toto It doesn't feel like a big upgrade, I'd say.
I want to know the story behind the guy on the bus wearing the suit, holding a giant poster board and a quart of milk.
@odie haha, completely misread that. Sorry! It was a smooth upgrade for me, too.
Downloading OS X Mavericks. Finally I shall surf the web on a surf-themed operating system.
@odie Do you know what messed it up? I'm downloading it now and don't want that to happen.
Glad @pluto told the @scoobydoo crowd that the Bay Area has great burritos.
Excited to see @pluto give his talk!
Thank you for Sriracha sauce, Huy Fong Foods.
For those who don't know, this is what computers are like.
@hachiko Right. I didn't quite agree with the article -I think they missed the point.
@hachiko I thought it odd to suggest that some women may not even WANT a seat at the table, rather than some PEOPLE may not want one.
@santoslhalper haha, thanks! In what way(s) are we similar?
@hachiko Would be interested to know your thoughts on this.
@dug But do people /dislike/ GitHub?
Are there programmers who don't like GitHub?
Happy Ada Lovelace Day!
Pi is a silly constant.
Wow I wish I had more Google+ ads in every part of Google.
@clifford glad it could help! good luck!
My class is being taught by a brony.
@snoopy Any reason to use Disconnect Search with DuckDuckGo? Perhaps to hide my searches from an ISP?
Makin' apps and takin' naps.
Just added Korean support to Humanize Duration, my little JavaScript library for turning milliseconds into words.
@eddie EJS is probably more accessible to people who already know HTML, but I like Jade.
@hachiko Really good. Like, really good.
Seeing Radiolab live! Very excited.
@eddie I like Jade. Makes for fewer lines of code.
@snoopy you disgust me.
Just taking normal screenshots while browsing the web.
@balto I believe the first version isn't written in CoffeeScript, but each subsequent version can be written in the previous version.
How many people are in space right now, dot com.
I completed You Can't JavaScript Under Pressure in 3 minutes, 16 seconds! Can you code quicker?
Blog post about Origin, my entry to @rintintin:.
Does Lynx support JavaScript.
@hachiko Glad you enjoyed it! Hope it helps.
A look at the complexity of JavaScript web frameworks shows Ember and Angular on top:.
@clifford thanks! Glad they could help.
@snoopy I left a blue water bottle at the VMWare talk in the Chrysler Building. Any chance you could put it in the lost &amp; found?
I love how they keep saying danger zone in the latest episode of This American Life.
@toto Glad you liked it!
@eddie You can. It appears in the real browser console, not the Console tab.
Just beat The JavaScript Warrior. A lot of fun!
I Am An Object Of Internet Ridicule, Ask Me Anything by @balto.
The Look In Your Eyes EP by @odie. TOO FUNKY.
Excited for @eddie this weekend. I intend to build a robot that destroys all humans.
@lassie If you need help understanding Express, I wrote a guide that might help!
@rintintin I'm going to sleep but girl I got u.
@marmaduke I've done a TINY bit. Basically no.
@marmaduke CoffeeScript and Sugar.js is also that way.
Just updated my Understanding Express.js guide for the latest version of Express. Enjoy!
The new @scoobydoo album is EXCELLENT.
Is there a way I can drive a car with hjkl.
@santoslhalper I use the latest -1.6.x.
@dug What bothers you about Jade?
@pluto Thanks! Glad you like it :).
@rintintin I get stuck at the loading screen in three different browsers! :(.
@rintintin aw girl, thanks for retweeting me.
Play my @hachiko submission! It's horrible. You'll love it.
Get a version of the book made out of PURE INFORMATION.
The new @scoobydoo album...it's too good.
@snoopy Definitely. I might ask for your help with synths; I'm clueless.
@snoopy I'm trying to code up a DAW in my spare time and it's both fun and confusing. Would love your feedback sometime.
@snoopy Thanks for the follow! Do you do music...stuff?
Shag carpet may have gone out of style, but rubbing your feet on them never will.
illuminati pizza followed you.
Does anyone on Twitter know what websites are.
@lassie Yes to both, I believe.
Every now and again, I have to go into a DOS command prompt, and it is a struggle.
Does CoffeeScript Have a Future?
Got really hype today explaining HTTP.
I have the power to tweet nearly 145 characters.
@eddie girl please that's an adjective.
School is a prison — and damaging our kids seems a bit hard to believe in parts,  but a good read.
@scrappydoo I like @eddie and @toto and sometimes @pluto .
@dug do you want hella electro funk.
First day of the semester!
Anyone have experience with HTML canvas-based UIs?
@snoopy I see. I like that there are fewer lines of code and that it makes scoping easier, but I understand not liking CoffeeScript.
@snoopy Why does this matter to people? I'm genuinely curious; don't think me accusatory.
New Zealand bans software patents.
@santoslhalper @odie Absolutely -the setup is trickier, and sometimes not worth it.
@clifford Thanks for your App Settings on Express.js Middleware -super helpful!
@odie I prefer it because it enables me to write the same code in less time with fewer bugs. But it's a matter of preference.
@eddie my dad does that too.
@dug I'd check @rintintin .
@marmaduke Do what makes you most productive.
Is there a web application security newsletter of some kind?
NSA officers spy on love interests, which they call LOVEINT. I like that name a lot.
Can't believe I saw the Ballmer news on my weird Twitter list.
@hachiko ECMAScript 6 will hopefully solve this, and I think Browserify is a good solution too. But sometimes you just need to load stuff.
@hachiko that actually sounds like the worst.
@scrappydoo Noticed a typo in the FAQ: Every segment of a marketplace has it's different factors should be its different factors.
@balto In response to your comments here:  He wasn't observing Ramadan &amp; had a real ID. He's not to blame.
I'm at a loss for words -@santoslhalper was detained by the TSA for over four hours. Chilling stuff.
@rintintin Promises look a bit ugly in CoffeeScript. Setup is much harder (source maps, auto compilation, etc). I think it's worth it.
@toto That's what happens -I'm on a plane and they inject that script at the top of every page, which I'd love to block.
Playing around with mining Feathercoin (a Bitcoin-like currency). It's confusing stuff!
@toto Would love to add this to the list of blockables:.
@rintintin There's controversy around the topic, but I love CoffeeScript. Lets me write the same code in less time with fewer bugs.
@dug I see. Does your current JavaScript solution work?
@dug Why not just use .extends?
@dug What are you trying to do? What does the JS look like?
My phone wisely autocorrects Unicode to Unicorn.

Just posted my first Bower package!
Great (and funny) description of how hard it'd be to crack AES-256.
Needless to say, my family could NOT guess my brother's 20 Questions choice of oil derrick.
@marmaduke where are you off to now?
Going through a pretty serious pita chip withdrawal right now.
Just searched burrito on Shutterstock dot com.
@eddie I must say that I think ternary operators are harder to read.
@pluto I think that's because the ? checks if something is undefined or null, not truthy.
@scrappydoo I think it depends on whether you're building a large-scale app that'd benefit from type checking.
@snoopy Glad you liked it!
Fixing bugs and giving hugs.
@balto what the hell.
My first Android app.
@scoobydoo GitHub is down, it looks like.

SwiftKey got me turnt up.
Funniest video in earth history.
@santoslhalper MM is more artistic, OO is a more accessible game.
@rintintin i would pay infinite dollars.
@scoobydoo I want to make video games that look like that.
@dug Glad to see another Sriracha enthusiast out there.
Got that surgical precision in Mario Kart.
They did it. They made their website responsive.
@toto DID YOU SEE THAT GUY WHO SUBMITTED THREE LANGUAGES IN ONE FILE.
@eddie CoffeeScript is more mature and aims to improve JavaScript's syntax, where TypeScript adds features for compile-time checking.
@rintintin Glad you like them!
My life improved after I stopped caring about spaces versus tabs.
@marmaduke Glad you like it!
@hachiko woah damn your Scales thing is sick.
the new @lassie album, which is excellent.
Guys. I'm pretty sure I found the coolest cake ever created.
This is a great talk about becoming a real programmer. (Don't be fooled -it's not about JavaScript.).
All I want is for @pluto to release ▲PERFECT STRIDE▲ I have no other desires.
@toto Looks like you've been hacked.
@scoobydoo damn how ya doin is dope.
@scoobydoo what is this mob.
Time to have the perfect evening with Bobby Vinton.

I wish that you could sync the settings you've set in Chrome extensions.
Bootstrap 3 goes flat, mobile-first, and renames hero-unit to jumbotron, finally.
@santoslhalper I'd add some simple CSS to the web app to improve consistency with your mobile apps. One-line change.
Made a little music with Famitracker yesterday. It's confusing (to me) but very fun.
Fergie is real programming music.
Got my Vim lookin fly as hell.
Wow, Opera is just Chromium now.
@odie How can I help, as a US citizen?
@snoopy I looked up random facts before writing that; I had no idea either!
@hachiko I thought it goes afterward in that case. I suppose I'm not sure.
@scoobydoo What else is there?
@scoobydoo @scoobydoo Welcome to SoundCloud. It's real.
@hachiko move the comma in (insert Xbox One-80 pun here,).
@scoobydoo It wasn't much work to make my blog work in IE8, but I use PIE and some polyfills for IE8.
@snoopy Glad you liked that line. It was probably my favorite to write.
Despicable stuff. US government wants private SSL keys.
Pretty sure I'm never going to meet anyone amped about how great DRM is.
Just called in to.
@dug I'm one of your constituents. Please support the Amash amendment to curtail unconstitutional NSA surveillance.
I think Google's Chromecast is a pretty big deal.
@lassie I'm a big fan of BitBucket for private repos. It's like 90% of GitHub but unlimited private stuff.
@lassie You just open sourced BuddyMeme and I looked at your commit log and it's horrible.
@rintintin maybe that's a sign that you shouldn't get into Bluetooth.
@eddie i'm gonna be constantly doing acid until perfect stride comes out.
@toto I just got it on Steam for Mac -hit me up if you wanna play (and if it's even possible).
My jaw drops at this monolithic, 3432-line vimrc that is large enough to destroy Tokyo.
I wonder how many people who said the pen is mightier than the sword were killed with swords.
@toto On what system are you playing Borderlands 2?
@dug I mean…that's a thing that happens. It happens to me all the time.
What if you could see wifi?
@rintintin Not a bad idea at all.
I've been playing around with LÖVE, the Lua game engine. It kept me up past my bedtime.
@hachiko Furreal? It's my favorite as well.
@clifford a weird idea.
2015: every website is made with Bootstrap.
@odie I really liked Code School's Objective-C class (free).
@marmaduke announces integration with fetchmail.
smh if you aren't using Sugar.js.
I really don't like the programming term duck punching.
@hachiko truer words have never been tweeted.
My Promise, the new Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song!
@hachiko How does sleuth.vim adjust your tab settings? Does it look at the file and detect things? Does it go by file extension?
@hachiko how would you define the word suppy.
@scoobydoo Thank you for this link and I am now coffing.
@scrappydoo Are you using any Backbone plugins?
@snoopy What don't you like about it?

Switched to a new branch 'quiz_khalifa' (thanks @rintintin).
@toto Not sure, I'm not big into analytics.
@dug are you gonna get a Chrome Book.
I feel like the Vim/Emacs debate has probably claimed lives.
The worst part about Vim is that you can't give it a hug.
Unchecked NSA spying undermines freedom. We need transparency and accountability now.
@hachiko I'm gonna sound like an asshole when I say Google Chrome but it's good.
@hachiko I heard that -that's so surprising.
@toto DO NOT go on that guy's website. It's straight a virus.
Switched to a new branch 'pingpong_helmet' (thanks @rintintin).
Statistically speaking, is flying the safest method of travel? Better than driving, certainly, but safer than walking? Biking?
Three years later, FaceTime is still a crappy name.
zsh makes me smile.
@santoslhalper And now I feel like an idiot.
@clifford Glad it could help!
I stand with Snowden.
@santoslhalper That's a little over 4 views a person.

What if we changed the name of the United States to Murica.
What are people using dotjs for?
@odie pretty specific choice of ancient year.

@toto What is this Twitter MMO you've been playing.
@pluto Glad you liked it!
@hachiko for what reason?
@toto I'm glad you liked them.
@scoobydoo How can I help you with @clifford.
@toto Did you ever have a good android one?
Let's go on a Kanye Quest.
@santoslhalper Let me know if you love those.
@rintintin I've really liked Falcon Pro.
@scoobydoo Recently got an HTC One and I love it.
@santoslhalper I really like Falcon Pro. It's not quite Tweetbot but it's good.
I recently got an Android phone (HTC One). Anyone have any recommendations?
@scrappydoo good read. Thank you.
@scoobydoo Even if I'm not tracking sleep?
@scoobydoo I don't get SleepBot's alarms. Do they always go off?
@balto Would love to hear your impressions.
NSA spying flap extends to contents of U.S. phone calls.

First tweet from my new phone!
@marmaduke pls don't die.
Ooh, look at my sexy Chrome devtools.
@santoslhalper No. I don't think I even knew of OpenStack before this moment, sadly. I can help you with Linux-specific stuff.
@santoslhalper I can help you because I Linux.
@santoslhalper Why in the world.
@eddie I'm just getting it because I wanted one and because iOS 7 terrifies me. I will take your advice.

@clifford Glad you liked it! Thanks for sharing.
@santoslhalper Glad that you liked it!
@balto Glad they could help!

@marmaduke Thanks for writing about my Express.js tutorial on your blog! Honored that you shared it.

@dug Haha, glad you liked the quote. Hope the tutorial was helpful!
@eddie Haha, glad you liked the quote!
@clifford Glad you liked it!
@pluto Thanks for the ZSH configuration post -super helpful!
My Express.js tutorial made it into JavaScript Weekly! There must be some mistake.
What can I do to stop this stuff from happening?
@hachiko 1 GB = 1 MB. they're equivalent.
@snoopy That's either ballsy or those are fake passwords.
Alright, zsh. You will be mine.
@eddie Are your dotfiles (or your zshrc at least) on the internet?
@eddie I'm all about that customization. It's time to zsh.
@eddie Tell me everything you know about zsh.
@marmaduke Tell me about Fish. I'm thinking about ditching Bash for either Fish or zsh.
@lassie I suppose. I'm sure they wouldn't mind much.
@scrappydoo @toto guys what's with all the lasers coming out of your eyes and mouths.
@toto It's a good thing their music is excellent.
@toto Same with Dave Brubeck.
@scoobydoo I liked  Kim Pine.

@toto Ah, okay. I figured it was symlinking and not some special preference.
@toto Tell me more.
Hit terminal velocity on the Heelys.
Guys what if P decided to be equal to NP.
A method of timekeeping on Mars.
@snoopy is the LSAT on a Friday or Saturday?
@toto I thank you for improving my morning measurable amounts.
@lassie Your logo looks EXACTLY like the Open Source Initiative's. FYI.
@toto I am actually getting nostalgic tingles.
@toto …mother of god.
@toto WHERE? I LOVE Banjo-Kazooie.
Love what @rintintin is doing.
@santoslhalper It's not working for me either...
@eddie ignore that last b.
@eddie I'll take a look. Sails looks cool too, by the way b.
I just published a long guide about Express, the Node web framework. Enjoy!
@scoobydoo I'm on hookcity if you wanna join me.
@scoobydoo I'm writing a programming tutorial and it's FULL of references to anime. fyi.
@toto Indeed. I think I'd prefer a few more lines for a bit more readability!
Woah. Sinatra refactored into 6 lines of code.
What app are you using to get the branch names? he asks as he merges the branch named hit_90_on_the_segway.
mySQL, I beg of you, please.
I have three things on my desktop. (1) a folder called anime (2) pizza.gif (3) Evan Hahn learns the COBOL programming language.txt.
Wrath of Khan Academy.
@rintintin that's actually just for show.
@rintintin and my adorable pop-country lifestyle.
@rintintin your hyphens could use some work.
@odie I'm actually offended.
I'm writing a blog post and my favorite phrase so far is you will see a dark world of HTML crime.
I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag I just encountered the &lt;blink&gt; tag.
East should be the new North, says this article.
I am learning a little bit of Objective-C and I am amazed that anyone can get anything done.
@dug I prefer that approach too, but frameworks can let you iterate much more quickly if you're well-versed.
@toto rap game coffeescript.
@scoobydoo May it happen this summer as well.
@rintintin @odie Now I'm curious.
I am going to listen to this playlist.
I feel good when I see Merge pull request  from EvanHahn/twilight_rugrats_slashfic in the commit history.
My pull request from a branch called pizza_kickflip was not approved.
My Unicode prayers have been answered.
@eddie You know it.
Happy that my website looks okay in Lynx.
@scrappydoo haha, will do!
@odie I assume I can't use my student micro plan for whatever I want -they have to be school projects, right?
I sincerely hope I can't OD on fruit juice.
Didn't know about ZZ in Vim. A shorter :wq.
@scoobydoo If you are like me, it will soon consume you.
@hachiko I agree. I like so close to cool.
@hachiko I think Microsoft is close. A company of their scale could become cool again in one year.
@hachiko I think a visionary CEO would do them well.
@hachiko DAMNIT. I want them to win.
@toto Dat abstraction indeed.
@toto Basically, they compile to CSS to make it nicer. Just like CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript to make it nicer.
@toto As you get more into CSS, start using a preprocessor. SASS and and LESS are popular, though my favorite is Stylus.
@toto My blood is pure JavaScript/CoffeeScript so let me know if you need help.
@toto I don't think you can CoffeeScript without JS knowledge, but CoffeeScript is lovely.
@scoobydoo will check out.
I just read the word Java and thought of coffee, not the programming language. Is this what being normal is like.
@rintintin That was another time.
Sup haters I'm getting cool.
“We already have what practically amounts to a bytecode VM in our browsers”.
@hachiko I'll take a look!
@scoobydoo My logo looks perfect on this nerdy JavaScript website.
Just published my first package to npm! Scary and weird.
@scrappydoo Looks like it's down for some:.
@snoopy Yeah, it looks like it's down at the moment.
@eddie Have you a preference between TypeScript and CoffeeScript?
@lassie I'm a fan of it. They don't fix JavaScript's syntax like @marmaduke does, but they supplement it with a bunch of nice features.
@pluto Yeah. I don't think it's QUITE as good as GitHub, but I have to be looking for the weaknesses to find them.
@pluto Yeah. I use them for private repos because you get unlimited, but I think GitHub has the edge.
Bitbucket is slowly catching up with GitHub.
I had a dream where I became a pizza and it was cool.
Evan Hahn versus the snooze button.
@odie Here are my minor comments:.
@clifford @odie I don't know about that, but I'm happy to take a look.
I don't trust ternary operators. They're shifty.
@toto hit me up if you have questions.
@scoobydoo Because I don't like the tracking, I use @toto and block all ads pretty much unconditionally.
.@balto is just so cool.
@lassie Small bug (?) report: there are 2 albums called Sam Sparro by an artist of the same name. 1 is just previews, 1 real songs.
Birds aren't descended from dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs. … This is a good world.
@eddie I'm tempted to do a series called Evan Hahn Learns Weird Programming Languages. Your thoughts?
@eddie I'm tempted to learn it.
This is the weirdest programming language I've ever seen.
@balto love their homophobia.
Concept: making asynchronous JavaScript loading look synchronous.
There are just not enough flashlight apps out there.
@scoobydoo DAMNIT, I love this logo.
@dug I would love an npm sticker or t-shirt if DevSwag would like to make them!
I just wrote some code that will break in about eight thousand years.
Que Onda Quero Beck.
Every time I use Z, I'm amazed and very happy.
@scoobydoo I AM SO JEALOUS.
@santoslhalper I love it.
Just made my first commit to some @toto code!
PHP, please, I beg of you.
Does anyone out there prefer Mercurial to Git these days? Git seems to have one handily.
Don't know why I was so afraid of learning @scoobydoo. It's easy and I feel late to the party.
@toto IMO, didn't like it. I heard the second was much better.
If you'd like, use code DRM2013 today for 50% off on my @balto book!
Just played a few hours of Halo 1 for the PC. Oh, how I missed this game.
My favorite part: here are fish.
And so my summer begins.
@rintintin I am honoured to have provided you with your summer's soundtrack.
@marmaduke That'd be sweet!
I was going to write another semester, another dollar, but my tuition is about 40,000 bajillion times that.
There is one swivel chair in this exam room and I am sitting in it. I suspect it will double my grade.
@marmaduke Is there a way to post an RSS feed with a link to 8tracks?
@scoobydoo peep this beat.
@marmaduke Would love a Noon Pacific RSS feed.
@eddie I find that merges are always a pain but the alternative is do all your work on master.
Just passed 1000 points on @balto. My avatar is now an exquisite monkey.
Feeling kind of somber trying to work hashtag yolo, hashtag swag into my future epitaph.
smh if you're not listening to funk.
@rintintin Have you any experience with CDNjs?
@santoslhalper Wouldn't call myself smart, but this seems like it'd be slow, especially on mobile connections.
@dug Thanks for your HTML select/option list for US states! (This:.
@snoopy You could also post some ideas to the Internet Wishlist.
If you love C++, I'd love to hear why.
I'm not a big fan of C++, but C++11 makes things a lot less infuriating.
@odie I'm lucky -I'm flying home on Wednesday. I won't rub it in.
@dug he also had some issues with his monkey iirc.
@odie I want to go to there.
@scoobydoo I know, but I can't believe I'll probably live to see fusion power happen.
FaceTime is a horrible name.
I had no idea we were on the way to fusion power. This is big stuff.
phuby wraps PHP in a loving embrace.
@balto I figured as much.
1981 $300,0001987 $50,0001990 $10,0001994 $1,0001997 $1002000 $102004….
Just got my first popup in years, from @toto, no less.
@clifford i don't like my stuff anymore i just kick it from my head, you know what i'm sayin, i can do that.
fergalicious no dictionary results.
@hachiko Voting would be awesome. I'm a coder and I'd love to help for a few hours if I can!
This is what we call bullshit pseudoscience.
This might be the coolest programming news story I have read.
I think the Internet Wishlist (@pluto) has untapped potential.
I just had to stop reading Twitter because I was laughing so hard.
I don't know if I could ever fall in love with Objective-C.
Hit me up on the Internet Relay Chat.
Just backed my first @snoopy project!
Just watched Minecraft: The Story of Mojang. Would recommend!
@lassie I'd love an Add to Rdio feature.
@eddie Any plans to add CoffeeScript support?
smh if you don't prefer CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
Just watched my first episode of a Korean drama. I could get into it.
Do yourself a favor and listen to @snoopy.
@hachiko I have to use it for work and it's confusing as hell.
Sugar.js is a pleasure to use. Imagine a world where JavaScript had a great standard library.
I'm glad funk is back in the mainstream. Thanks, Daft Punk.
I'm switching operating systems.
My roommate just caught me bobbing my head REAL hard at the Super Nintendo Zelda soundtrack.
@scoobydoo I was just asking for an Android-using friend of mine.
@scoobydoo also, listen to the Daft Punk single.
@dug i &lt;3 kreayshawn.
@scoobydoo What's the sleep app you use?
@dug Gucci Gucci Loui Loui Fendi Fendi Prada.
@toto How can I get involved and help? Pardon my ignorance.
That guy was probably not wise to be texting on a motorcycle.
Dat Ann Arbor weather today.
@santoslhalper that's hilarious Hahn.
Quitting Google Reader has actually been great.
Wait...Chat Heads are actually SWEET. I want that API for everything, not just Facebook.
It is time to move on from Backbone.js -I agree. A comparison of front-end JavaScript frameworks.
@santoslhalper Thank @scoobydoo for the logo.
@santoslhalper it's a DELIGHT.
English Teacher Needs Your Help -And Your Blood!
@scrappydoo I swear by Tweetbot.
Locked myself out, but I ate some delicious pizza earlier.
@balto Have you any places in mind?
Just voted for @lassie for the best UX in the Webby Awards.
@clifford I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan and I oppose CISPA. FYI.
OH THANKS FOR THE BUS ERROR, C++, YOU'RE JUST A DELIGHT TO PROGRAM IN.
@marmaduke I LOVE CoffeeScript, and I'm not the only one. GitHub and Dropbox are two major companies that use it.
@santoslhalper In CoffeeScript, I think that nomenclature exists to contrast between =&gt; and -&gt;.
@hachiko I believe it's considered bad practice to have compiled files under version control.
Am I a man of mystery if I just like mysteries.
@odie It doesn't? I had luck with it on my Mac.
@balto Yeah, it's silly. At least there's a plugin for it.
@lassie In what way?
@toto Yeah, it's what I use.
@toto Maybe once every two weeks? It just seems like I'm at the mercy of software, which isn't how it should be.
@toto Perhaps I need to learn iOS development to help my 10 gazillion friends.
@toto I archive a lot of stuff, but I'd rather not have to search everywhere to find an old note.
@toto My main problem with iOS text editors is that they don't handle thousands of notes well. Have you any recommendations?
@marmaduke Y'all should add yourselves to this page.
@eddie Really? I'm intrigued.
Computer program that learns to play classic NES games is the coolest thing I have ever seen.
@scoobydoo so is homophobia.
@eddie Agreed. I wish Daytum were still developed.
@scrappydoo Microsoft Office 2003 and N64 games.
@rintintin hey can you arrange another playdate for me and Joe.
@scrappydoo Yeah, I can't really complain!
Every time I use Windows 8, I'm amazed at how much I don't understand Windows 8.
Illiterate except for emoji.
Still deciding what to do with my Raspberry Pi.
@scrappydoo Not really. I bought .5 BTC when it was around $75 and sold when it was about $135.
The real question: will Chrome's new Blink engine support &lt;blink&gt;?
Great presentation on CoffeeScript versus TypeScript.
@marmaduke I'll let you know when I get it and then when I love it.
Bitcoin is going down a lot -glad I sold when I did.
@rintintin You should try Minecraft. It's not quite as volatile as bitcoin but is much more fun.
@marmaduke You've convinced me.
@dug You might like The Little Book on CoffeeScript.
@snoopy What environment are you on? I'm looking for a good TypeScript editor.
@pluto Are you using TypeScript on a non-Windows machine? What development tools do you use?
@scoobydoo rap game i love my logo.
@rintintin Haha, glad you liked it.
@scoobydoo The is it snowing? example on the goodies page doesn't seem to work. FYI.
This is a fantastic idea: They Should Paint The Bay Bridge Gold.
What if I made a text adventure MMO.
People will still say hashtag swag in the year 2522.
Geneva Convention over configuration.
I like how I use a text editor that's older than I am.
@balto I'll check them out -thank you!
@balto Anything you'd recommend? Pardon my ignorance.
@hachiko It'll go down eventually. It's interesting to watch, though.
@hachiko About $50. I bought 0.5 BTC.
@balto Do you use any plugins?
I've made $8 by investing in Bitcoin. This is getting interesting.
Sometimes I want to scream I hate C++ but I'm never in a thunderstorm.
Part of me misses when the whole internet looked like this.
@marmaduke I will read every word.
@pluto Hit me up on internet chat and I'll tell you.
@pluto Take my hand, I will show you the way.
Just beat Bioshock Infinite. Spoilers: WHAT.
@pluto next time perhaps.
Wow, PHP is bad.
All magic comes with a price.
My roommate and I are getting good at making bulgogi.
Is it pathetic that I programmed my computer to wish me happy birthday.
I'd rather be in Boston.
Using Windows for the first time in many years. This is uncharted territory.
@santoslhalper I tried to make it short -I hope you like it!
You can now buy the digital copy of my book on @balto! Do you have any idea how horrifying this is?
@eddie Love what you guys are doing -making me proud to be from the Bay Area!
@santoslhalper Thanks! It's my first book, so let me know if you have any questions!
@santoslhalper Looks like the ebook of my book is out!
I had a dream that I tried to surf around Michigan.
You just received 0.000008 BTC (worth $0 USD) from an external bitcoin account.
@dug For non-rap stuff too?
What's the best lyrics site? I feel like most of them are horrible.
To confuse it's and its is to commit a cruel grammarcrime.
Jason Derulo needs to stop saying Jason Derulo because he is not a Pokémon.
I'm becoming an avid bus surfer.
@lassie I don't like that it does very little. Without extensions, you write a lot of boilerplate code that should be left to a library.
@santoslhalper FYI: my Jasmine book is still not released but will be arriving soon!
@pluto I'll race you. I'm still in bed.
@lassie Depends. I don't like Backbone, but I had to use it once. Same with Ember. I like Knockout and Funnyface. Angular seems best.
@lassie I admit I'm not an Angular man, so I can't be too helpful. It's on my to-do list of things to learn, though.
@marmaduke Does this interest you?
@eddie I'd pay around a dollar (US) to summarize an article probably once a month.
The @odie status page says everything operating normally, but I can't push/pull over SSH.
@scrappydoo Looks like it:.
Good luck getting all systems back online, @odie!
@lassie Because Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework, it's not designed for testing private methods.
@toto What did you define as git yolo?
@odie It looks like they're being DDoS'd:.
@hachiko Looks like @odie is being DDoSed:.
@clifford It might have to do with the fact that they're being DDoSed:.
@marmaduke Yup. Looks like they're being DDoSed:.
@scrappydoo It looks like @odie is being DDoSed:.
@dug Looks like they're being DDoSed:.
@lassie Their status page says that they're being DDoS'd:.
@marmaduke Looks like they're being DDoSed:.
@odie Looks like it:.
@hachiko Do you like Mailbox?
@santoslhalper I believe the book isn't released. I'll let you know when it's out. You can read my quick guide for now:.
@hachiko Ember seems HUGE and kind of scary.
This bus driver is making it hard to surf, but I'm still able to type this with two hands while standing. Phew.
My professor kinda just wrote a shell in class. It was much shorter than I thought it'd be.
Blog post: Backbone.js is larger than you think.
The @clifford is very impressive.
@snoopy i have way too much work to have built this on a whim.
@clifford Could you break this down somehow?
Twitter just told me to reconnect with someone so I unfollowed them.
@eddie LOVE my Dell monitors. Good choice.
@rintintin How do I find archived lists and tasks?
@toto Tell me everything.
@toto I'm slowly falling in love with Sublime. fyi.
Just spent about 10 seconds mashing Caps Lock repeatedly in an effort to make it function like the Tab key.
Thanks to @toto for telling me about Mosh!
Anyone have large-sized pixel art landscape wallpapers? Stuff like this  but a little larger.
If you HAVE to use Backbone.js, Epoxy.js looks like the best library for doing data binding.
Rap game inbox zero.
@scoobydoo I just wanna tweet a lot so that I can see my logo.
@hachiko @scoobydoo Odd. Perhaps my (already-merged) pull request was in error.
The only thing I remember from my dream last night was that I paid $80 for a normal pizza.
Thanks to @scoobydoo for my first-ever logo! Look at this thing! It's so sweet!
@scoobydoo ...very. I didn't get those results on OSX chrome.
@scoobydoo Should I submit a pull request?
@scoobydoo Not that big a deal in Firefox, but I'd object to using Boolean because it's a reference type, right?
@hachiko that looks pretty swee.
@scoobydoo what is the future like.
@scoobydoo Couldn't it also be var isChrome = !!window.chrome;?
For all of my *nix friends: use this. It will change you.
Awesome list of browser-specific hacks.
I'd rather be bus surfing.
I can't quite get the lighting right for this duckface selfie.
@dug not sure what that meant.
@dug no, like you look nothing like her.
My music shuffle is KILLING it rn.
@toto That was the debate I had.
@dug that looks nothing like you.
@toto I can't intuitively imagine vomit exiting the passenger's seat and entering the driver's.
@toto from the passenger's seat to the driver's?
Holy gosh, Vimperator is SWEET.
Spring has graced Ann Arbor today.
@scoobydoo I hate MATLAB.
@toto That sounds like JavaScript and I'm sorry.
@hachiko LOVE the design of your site. Would you mind if I stole some of it for mine?
@santoslhalper Not sure. Gaining popularity (see  Testing and Benchmarking); Node out of the box; bit more difficult.
@toto @santoslhalper That's me.
I made yet another JavaScript class library: Classy.
Michigan, I am in you.
Airplane mode = infinite battery life.
I think I might be the 5th-most attractive person on this flight.
Disappointed that my spring break isn't endless.
@hachiko * { box-sizing: border-box; }.
Hint of lime = hint of nasty.
Just opened /etc/services for the first time. There's a LOT of stuff in there!
Anyone who knows the Aloha Editor able to help me?
Props to Zenhabits for having no copyright.
There is so much cool stuff on this planet.
Typing this with two hands while bus surfing!
@snoopy Thanks! I might make it a Chrome extension.
I don't mean to brag, but let's just say that I put the E in JavaScript.
Even I can't fully appreciate how much I love KT Tunstall's music.
@scoobydoo those are SO SICK.
I'm at a review session and the reviewer is using Emacs. I'm tempted to raise my hand and ask why he isn't using Vim.
@snoopy Join me in hating it.
@toto It's a detailed process.
Evan Hahn: certified lover of the plum tea he bought from that cool Korean supermarket.
I know about Weird Twitter, but is there a Weird LinkedIn.
Every terms of service should look like this.
I didn't know that JavaScript used to be called Mocha.
7:15am will be my bedtime tonight.
Evan Hahn: eater of pizza.
@santoslhalper exactly. I'm in bed for a longass time.
@santoslhalper Sorry, completely messed that up. Fermata.
A hub made entirely of gits.
@santoslhalper It's more like my legato.
Because this is a half-semester course, the first exam I'm taking this semester is also a final.
@scoobydoo Weird little bug on the Wikipedia snippet.
Nobody here reads the git logs. So I've started adding things about my coworkers to my commits.
Java is to JavaScript as Car is to Carpet.
I wouldn't say that getting out of bed is my forté.
Well, this is spooky. Welcome to the Malware-Industrial Complex.
OH: No, Java! No!
@marmaduke I find indent guides very helpful. I use the Indent Guides plugin for Vim, and it's built into Sublime.
@marmaduke I find the JS output very readable. There are ways to debug it directly that I should be doing, but I've never felt the need.
The @hachiko framework looks sweet.
All I want to do is write CoffeeScript code and ignore my C++ project.
This is how I feel about Java.
Just wrote var instead of far. My transformation into JavaScript Man has begun.
CSS, I beg you, please.
These beats are inhumanely dope.
Ugh, Bungie's new game looks really sweet.
@toto Looks like some stuff on there is outdated -jQuery is one example.
Looks like @scrappydoo is down.
@scrappydoo On YouTube, yes.
How can you program if you're blind? I always wondered.
Back To The Ground @rintintin.
@dug I think it's better now.
@eddie Yeah, it's happening to me and a bunch of other people.
@snoopy Seems like not, sadly.
@clifford It's not just you, by the way -Facebook messages are down for lots of people (including me).
@balto Yeah. A quick search on Twitter showed that we're not the only ones with the problem, it seems.
@rintintin Yeah -I think it's just Facebook that's weird right now.
@lassie Seems like it -the same thing is happening to me.
@snoopy I'm having the same problem.
@rintintin Facebook Messages aren't working (and they're not just down for me, according to twitter).
@pluto Yeah, mine aren't working either.
@scoobydoo same thing is happening to me.
@balto Yeah, it's happening to me.
iOS is overwhelmingly blue.
@dug I think you do. I'm not totally sure about the protocol. (Add me, though.).
Facebook inbox slow for anyone else? Messages won't load on my computer or phone.
@hachiko I am excited.
@hachiko I'm particularly fond of ALL OF IT.
@hachiko Is Fetchnotes written in CoffeeScript? If so, y'all should add it here:.
@odie Thanks for translating -do feel better!
@odie Pretty sure I was quoting you.
@odie I'm learning  -could you translate that last sentence?
mi kama sona toki.
Feature story about invented languages. Among the most interesting things I've read recently.
Happy Chinese New Year!
I took a public-domain image from @odie and turned it into a wallpaper.
Take me to your dopest beat.
The microwave oven is an incredible invention.
Buckwheat Groats on LOOP.
@lassie @scrappydoo Ohh, I get it now. And I agree about Prototype. At least they also added more money with the $$ function.
@scrappydoo I know that Resig is the author, but how was query the answer to the clue? Maybe I don't listen to enough Ke$ha.
Can anyone help me with 17 across, 22 across, and 5 down?
@marmaduke Like...I don't think I fully get what I'm supposed to do when I log on.
@hachiko GET ON MY ARMAGEDTRON LEVELLLL.
@hachiko don't you worry.
@marmaduke Can you teach me how to use Quora properly? It seems cool and I have no idea how to work it.
What's the best way to learn how to get good with shell scripting?
@hachiko Pushed some changes to the js1k repo. If you run flores, you'll see that I want to make some kind of game.
Wow PHP is horrible.
My life became way worse when I realized that every person on earth has ugly knees.
@toto I am not in 281, though.
@hachiko @scoobydoo Maybe -I didn't go to Pennapps.
@toto How should I interact with these fellows?
@toto I feel like I've suddenly been thrown into a beautiful Twitter thread.
@snoopy tip: British people call it rocket which is sick.
@toto Sweet -I'll likely use this. I do use Sublime about once a week, so I'll use this.
@toto Teach me. You will not convert me from Vim, but teach me.
PLEASE LET US LEAVE YOUR DUNGEON.
highlights: FrankenFruit, pizza, no sleep.
quick question: what is a computer.
@clifford Thanks! Glad you liked it.
So tired, but I built this for.
Wow, I'm dizzy tired.
8:08am: bedtime. Waking up in under two hours.
Wake up, we're going to feed you snakes now.
5:57am and I'm off to bed.
@santoslhalper let me know when it's launched!
@eddie Thanks for presenting OpenShift!
@santoslhalper lemme know if you build it!
@dug I don't think I'll be using the Ribbon API at  but I think I'll use it for another project. Thanks!
@toto there's a livestream.
@santoslhalper I'd use it!
@clifford i cannot get enough of that gif.
@scoobydoo i cannot stop watching it.
EvanHahn: Tip: Sriracha sauce + macaroni and cheese = top-tier food.
@pluto You must trust me.
@pluto or just use Vim all day every day.
@snoopy what's your alt?
Just tried joining the @pluto IRC. It is HOPPING in there.
The Road Not Taken is a stupid poem.
@toto Thanks for awesome!
@toto Ah, sorry -it's called Taggify.
@santoslhalper students can use Virtual Sites to do cross-browser testing.
@toto Is Taggery something that should be blocked?
@hachiko WAIT, I THOUGHT THAT CAME OUT IN A FEW MONTHS.
All I want in LESS is transparent mixins.
@rintintin I got the Ingress invite but it looks like it's Android-only, sadly.
There is a time and place for Comic Sans: after you've died and are doing graphic design in hell.
Lost all faith in my programming professor when he told me that his variables are called x and his code contains things like x.x.good.
@pluto Yeoman is on my todo list to try. It seems awesome.
I somehow made bulgogi.
@pluto I use MacPorts but I SHOULD use Homebrew. I will use it on my next Mac.
Why are hyperlinks blue?
Does my university have a Calvinball team.
Last night I had 2 dreams: one of them had Neil deGrasse Tyson sleeping in my mansion and one of them had me and Obama playing paintball.
@hachiko the best meal I had this week was Panda Express.
Just used @lassie's remote control feature for the first time, and it's sweet.
Today, I am determined to understand Kreayshawn.
@hachiko Does this interest you?
@odie It seems useful if you control all of your CSS, but I can see it being abused. Not sure it's a problem, of course.
Nervous about the CSS4 parent selector.
Biggest problem in my life right now: I can't get Asciidoc highlighting to work in Vim. (PS I can never complain about anything ever).
@marmaduke and I will help you fix these bugs!
@odie I KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN.
smh if you say smh.
Holy gosh, my first merged pull request in a major open source thing!
@hachiko What's your email? I would like to discuss js1k stuff.
...we've all got the hang of this smartphone thing now. Let us do what we want.
The Words of Martin Luther King.
Trying RubyMine. Will it beat Vim??
@toto GUESS WHO JUST TEXTED ME.
@toto I agree wholeheartedly. What is this, Auschwitz?
@dug Can I come in with a team, though?
@dug Are teams randomly assigned, or can I come in with a team?
@toto I wish I could've gone to that!
@snoopy ok. Tell him to buy Borderlands 2 for Xbox.
@snoopy you will not be sick for something so legendary. Which game?
@snoopy @odie Feel better, heroes.
@toto @rintintin I doubt I'm getting a call.

@toto @toto Not yet.
@clifford I'd love to have Karma in Ann Arbor, MI.
@toto @rintintin I asked the waitress out. Be glad you weren't there.
This game seems like it is not at all copyright infringement.
I want to help out and put content on @clifford, but I am overwhelmed by the page editor.
The problem with charring meat at hypersonic speeds is...
@pluto Do you know how to open the JavaScript console?
Coding tip: stop writing code and become Jay-Z.
@pluto Message me if you have one I should hear and I'll tell you how to send it to me.
Playing around with @balto.
I should really have been doing work, but I instead tried coding a little drum machine.
Wait a minute. Prototype.js is kind of sweet.
I've made it 20 years without drinking more than a few sips of coffee, and I think it's time to be introduced.
Looks like @odie is down.
@eddie I build the things that I can't help but build because I'm so excited about them.
I'm really glad that we don't live on a tiny golden globe.
Ann Arbor Burger Month's first stop. (@ Krazy Jim's Blimpy Burger).
@marmaduke At least I was quick.
@marmaduke Thanks! It took a bit of doing to make work properly.
Just DOMINATED some Halo  Grifball -this excellent performance will propel me into a whirlwind of fame and money.
@pluto I guess that's true. It's harder to surf the southbound bus.
@pluto From where?? I am so confused. It's just like Bursley-Baits when you're going southbound.
@pluto Was it in the morning? Because then it's Danger Zone.
@pluto Worth the $60, by your estimation?
Is RubyMine worth it? I'm writing an increasing amount of Rails code.
I'd say there's a 20% chance that any given trending topic will be related to Justin Beiber.
@pluto In which direction did you take it?
Just ordered Borderlands 2 for Xbox. Goodbye, planet.
This was a nice reminder of why I'm at an engineering school.
@balto I should suffix all my tweets with.
I tweet this with two hands while surfing on a bus.
Blog post: Using the web in 2013 means using JavaScript.
@lassie No worries -I thought it was funny. I wish I could selectively enable that feature for some artists, though.
Google seems a lot scarier when you realize how much they know about you.
@toto DAMMIT! I quit wishes.
@hachiko it was weird, I got a pony LEG in the mail. it was kind of messed up.
So I went to check my @lassie notifications and.
Proud to have just taught someone the abbreviation ilubby.
11:11am Eastern time: I wish for a pony.
@snoopy Agreed. It IS useful in some cases though, to improve the user experience. Usually on only one element, like a button.

@odie Not just you. I've no idea.
To Ann Arbor! (@ San Francisco International Airport (SFO) w/ 147 others).
@eddie I'm glad! Thanks for reaching out.
@eddie Good luck! Sorry I can't be of more help -I haven't used Lua in years.
@eddie That one file is the only file in the project. My guess is that this is due to some Windows/Notepad++ wonkiness.
@eddie That seems odd; tonumber expects a string  and converts it to a number. Try changing it to tonumber(xyz, 10).
@eddie What version of Lua are you using, and on what platform? I'm on a Mac and lua -v outputs Lua 5.1.4.
@eddie Just one file -call it whatever you want (tictactoe.lua, for example). Then run it from the command line (lua tictactoe.lua).
@eddie Sure -what's wrong with it?
@snoopy personally, it's my favorite book.

@toto It's a book that my high school English teacher wrote, called After Dakota.
@toto No idea. I've thought about it but I'm not much of a writer.
Until today, I had never stayed up until 5:30am finishing a novel. Thankfully, I was reading a novel, not authoring one.

@hachiko will do. I don't mountain lion because I'm cheap.
Great video of @lassie and @dug having a chat.
Happy couples are my favorite kind of couple, but mixed-race couples are a close second.
@hachiko my text to speech instructions MIGHT be different on mountain lion.
@lassie It launches fine in airplane mode. Thanks!
@odie App's repeatedly crashing on my iPhone 4 after update. Sometimes it gets past the loading screen &amp; crashes, sometimes not.

Solve a perennial programming quandary: 'How do I take good data in string form and painlessly turn it into garbage?'.
Version 2.0 of the @lassie app is pretty nice so far, but for the truckload of syncing.
Facebook Messenger for Mac would be greatly appreciated. By me.
No one was going to see, so I used tables in my HTML.
@balto I admit that I'm kind of interested in moving around the country for awhile before I settle down somewhere.
@pluto I might be able to -what time on Friday? Pop me a DM.
@pluto Possibly -what day(s)?
Switching to Linux saves Munich over €11 million.
@hachiko The colors are better and the connection is more reliable (but that was probably just because I had a bad VGA cable).
@toto I think I'd rather be a porn star than an assassin. Food for...food for thought.
Wow, a DVI cable makes a ton of difference. VGA, begone!

I feel like Ultimate Frisbee should only be for incredibly extreme people and everyone else should get Regular Frisbee.
@hachiko Only flirted. It looks even nicer. This project kinda requires Knockout.
@hachiko I'm so surprised at how little JavaScript I'm writing.
@pluto Oh yeah, ModelBinder is a great plugin. Big fan...except I don't much like Backbone.
@pluto It's MVVM, not MVC. More like XAML; less templating and DOM building.
Finally trying Knockout.js. So far, I like it better than Ember and Backbone.
@toto I think your excitement indicates that you deserve it more than I ever did. I feel like I'm passing an epic torch.
@toto haha, no idea. Briefly, I think.
Sometimes, I can feel the age of my iPhone 4.

This song starts out sounding like an old video game, then is briefly reggae, then is NASTY dubstep. Queued up as  of the day.
@balto I wanted it to be enumerable. So, if I'm at beat 5, I can go forward to 6 or back to 4. Harder with date primary keys on hashmaps.
NO WAY. This is too cool.
@rintintin I tried sleeping for two 4-hour chunks every day. After three days of it, I couldn't stay awake and slept for 15 hours.

@marmaduke Good luck, heroes.
I have  queued up for almost a month but I still need more to fuel my addiction.
@hachiko @scoobydoo fair point.

Sometimes, I forget to use vimdiff and use diff -y instead, and then I feel stupid.
@dug I am anal about little style choices like that.
@dug Then you are wrong.
If you put two spaces after your periods instead of one, I respect you less.
@rintintin Yeah. It was horrible.
@rintintin I agree. I did a Star Wars marathon once and I physically hurt.

Obama: Okay, I'm just gonna try something now. I'm gonna beatbox and you guys rap and we'll just see where things go.
Obama: All we need is James Bond and more sushi, and then America will be, like, the sweetest nation I could ever imagine.
Obama's telling me I have to do more than just vote?? He asks too much.

@marmaduke Absolutely I did! Wish I competed. So excited for Super Mario Maker.
Guys! Warning: Fatso's Last Stand is pretty fucking gross when you are sober.
Uncharted 4 looks like a Fast and Furious movie; really good.
Mario Maker blew my mind. Can't wait to play it.
Guys, Ryu is currently available as DLC for Smash 4. Nintendo is just the best. Sunday Daddy happy. Close down E3. DOOM is for babies.
Guys! Best Wii U Games in no order: Mario3D, Smash4, Bayonetta2, C.Toad, Pikmin3, Splatoon, DKTFreeze, MKart, LegoUndercover, NewMarioWiiU.
@marmaduke theoretically Splatoon 64 &lt; Splatoon Melee &lt; Splatoon Brawl &lt; Splatoon 4 (the new one). Just like Smash.
Splatoon is v fun. If this was the 4th iteration of Splatoon, it would be the best. Better than Splatoon Melee.
Guys it's confirmed that n64 smash is the worst followed by gamecube smash. Brawl is second best. Smash 4 is the best.

@scrappydoo @scrappydoo Psst. You should tweet the 6-digit hashtag with the question so RoboTrebek know what you are answering.
@snoopy Haha. Ok, I will play around with it this weekend. Thanks for the support!
@snoopy I am only allowed to make 15 api requests an hour.  I could make it tweet all the daily answers at once. Would you like that?
@snoopy As it is programmed right now, shorter answers are better. Ex: President Lincoln might be incorrect where Lincoln is correct.
@snoopy So anyone who answers correctly gets the dollar value associated with the answer. They can also get money taken away.
@scrappydoo Can you see this?
@lassie Thanks for the can crush beebee! You are the man!!!!
Just to let everybody know, the only reason that I got a twitter account is to follow @lassie.
